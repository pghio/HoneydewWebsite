# Cozi Gold Price 2025: Is It Worth $29.99/Year? (Honest Review)

**Quick Answer:** Cozi Gold costs **$29.99/year** (or $4.99/month) in 2025. You get ad removal, month calendar view, color customization, and a birthday tracker. **Our verdict:** For basic family calendars, Cozi Gold is decent value. But modern alternatives like **Honeydew** offer AI planning, voice control, and multi-family support for similar pricing—features Cozi lacks entirely.

## Is Cozi Gold Worth $29.99/Year?

### ✅ Yes, Cozi Gold Is Worth It If:

**1. You're already using Cozi Free and hate the ads**

The ads in Cozi Free are annoying—banner ads on every screen, occasional full-screen interruptions. If you use Cozi daily, $30/year to remove them is reasonable.

**2. You want the month view**

The free version limits you to week/agenda views. If seeing the full month at a glance is important (great for busy families), Gold unlocks this.

**3. You have simple family needs**

Single household, basic calendar sharing, simple lists. Cozi Gold handles this well for $30/year.

**4. You're non-technical and want the simplest app**

Cozi has almost no learning curve. If your family struggles with technology, Cozi's simplicity is a feature.

### ❌ No, Cozi Gold Is NOT Worth It If:

**1. You want AI features**

Cozi has zero AI—no smart planning, no natural language, no automation. You type everything manually. If you want AI assistance, look elsewhere.

**2. You need voice control**

Busy parents need hands-free input while cooking, driving, or wrangling kids. Cozi has no voice input whatsoever.

**3. You have a complex family structure**

Divorced parents, extended family coordination, multiple households? Cozi only supports ONE family group. You can't coordinate across two homes.

**4. You want two-way calendar sync**

Cozi only syncs one-way TO external calendars. Changes you make in Google Calendar won't sync back to Cozi. This is frustrating if you use multiple calendar apps.

**5. You value modern features**

Cozi's app feels like 2010. No dark mode, dated design, slow performance. If modern UX matters to you, Cozi will disappoint.

### Cost-Per-Feature Analysis

**Cozi Gold ($30/year) gets you:**

**Honeydew Premium ($96/year) gets you:**
- AI agent with 27+ tools
- Whisper AI voice input
- Unlimited family groups
- Two-way calendar sync

**The question:** Is $66/year more worth it for dramatically more features?

For most families, the answer is **yes**. Honeydew's AI saves 3-5 hours/week—that's 156+ hours/year. Even at minimum wage, that's worth far more than $66.

## Bottom Line: Cozi Gold in 2025

**Cozi Gold at $29.99/year is decent value for basic family organization.** If you just need a shared calendar, shopping lists, and meal planning without ads, it does the job.

**However, Cozi is showing its age.** While competitors have added AI, voice control, and modern features, Cozi Gold is essentially the same product from 2015 with ads removed.

**For modern families, Honeydew offers significantly more value:**
- AI that saves 3-5 hours/week
- Voice control for multitasking
- Multi-family support for modern family structures
- Two-way calendar sync
- Modern design

The $66/year difference pays for itself many times over in time saved.
