# Todoist vs Any.Do vs Honeydew: Task-First vs Family-First 2026

**Quick Answer:** These three apps represent fundamentally different philosophies for managing tasks. **Todoist** ($4/month) is the power user's dream—legendary natural language input, 80+ integrations, and gamification that makes productivity addictive. It's the undisputed champion for individual task management. **Any.Do** ($3/month) offers solid task management with built-in calendar integration at the most affordable price point—great for budget-conscious users who want simplicity. **Honeydew** ($7.99/month) takes a completely different approach: family-first AI coordination with unlimited members, multi-family groups, and voice control. The right choice depends entirely on your use case: **For individuals, Todoist wins. For budget-conscious solo users, Any.Do wins. For families, Honeydew wins—and it's not close.**

## Understanding the Three Approaches

### Todoist: The Productivity Maximalist

**Founded:** 2007 
**Users:** 42+ million 
**Philosophy:** "Task management perfected for ambitious individuals"

Todoist is the Ferrari of task management apps. It's fast, beautiful, and designed for people who take productivity seriously. The natural language input is legendary—"Buy milk tomorrow 3pm p1 #Errands @Sarah" creates a perfectly formatted task instantly. The Karma gamification system has motivated millions to crush their to-do lists. With 80+ integrations, it fits into any workflow.

**Todoist is exceptional if you're:** A productivity enthusiast, solo professional, or team collaborating on work projects.

**Todoist struggles if you're:** Trying to coordinate a family who won't learn productivity workflows.

### Any.Do: The Practical Minimalist

**Founded:** 2011 
**Users:** 40+ million 
**Philosophy:** "Simple task management for everyone"

Any.Do is the reliable Honda Civic of productivity apps. It does what you need, doesn't cost much, and has a built-in calendar that many competitors lack. The "My Day" planning feature helps you focus on what matters today. It's not trying to be everything—it's trying to be good enough at an affordable price.

**Any.Do is excellent if you're:** Budget-conscious, want simplicity, or need basic task-calendar integration.

**Any.Do struggles if you're:** A power user needing advanced features, or a family larger than 4 members.

### Honeydew: The Family Coordinator

**Founded:** 2024 
**Users:** Growing (newer entrant) 
**Philosophy:** "AI-powered coordination for modern families"

Honeydew isn't trying to compete on individual task management. Instead, it asks a different question: "How do we eliminate the invisible labor of family coordination?" The 27-tool AI agent generates complete checklists from simple requests. Voice control works while your hands are covered in spaghetti sauce. Multi-family architecture handles divorced parents, extended family, and modern complexity.

**Honeydew is transformative if you're:** Managing a family, especially complex or multi-household situations.

**Honeydew is overkill if you're:** A solo user focused on personal productivity.

---

## The Individual vs Family Divide

Let's be crystal clear about something most comparison articles won't tell you:

**Todoist and Any.Do are individual productivity apps that added sharing features.**

**Honeydew is a family coordination app that happens to manage tasks.**

{{HONEYDEW_EMBED:family-chore-chart-checklist}}


This distinction matters enormously:

| Individual App + Sharing | Family-First App |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| Designed for your personal workflow | Designed for household coordination |
| Sharing is an add-on feature | Collaboration is the foundation |
| Per-user pricing makes sense | Per-family pricing makes sense |
| Assumes everyone uses the app | Assumes one coordinator + family members |
| Power features for the user | AI assistance for the coordinator |
| Your productivity is the goal | Family harmony is the goal |

**If you're reading this for yourself as an individual:** Todoist or Any.Do will likely serve you better.

**If you're reading this because you coordinate a family:** Keep reading, because the comparison changes dramatically.

## Head-to-Head Feature Comparison

### AI & Automation

| Capability | Todoist | Any.Do | Honeydew |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Natural language task input | ✅ **Best-in-class** | ✅ Good | ✅ Good |
| AI list generation | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **27 tools** |
| Complex request handling | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Multi-step workflows |
| Learning from usage | ⚠️ Basic | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ **80% cache hit** |
| Family pattern recognition | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Smart scheduling | ⚠️ Via integrations | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ AI-powered |

**The AI Test:**

Tell each app: "Create a packing list for a family camping trip with kids ages 5 and 8."

- **Todoist:** Creates one task called "Create a packing list for a family camping trip with kids ages 5 and 8" — You still have to make the list yourself.
- **Any.Do:** Same result — one task, no list generated.
- **Honeydew:** Generates 50+ categorized items (tent, sleeping bags, kid-appropriate snacks, first aid, activities by age group, etc.) in 5 seconds.

**Winner: Honeydew** — Todoist has exceptional INPUT parsing, but Honeydew's AI does the actual WORK.

---

### Voice Control

| Capability | Todoist | Any.Do | Honeydew |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Native voice input | ❌ (external required) | ⚠️ Basic dictation | ✅ Whisper AI |
| Accuracy rate | Varies by integration | ~85% (quiet) | 96.3% |
| Background noise handling | Depends on device | Poor | ✅ Kitchen/car ready |
| Complex commands | Single tasks only | Single tasks only | ✅ Multi-part requests |
| Family-specific commands | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Built-in |
| Languages supported | Via integration | Limited | 50+ |

**The Voice Test:**

While cooking dinner (pots clanging, kids yelling):

- **Todoist:** "Hey Siri, add milk to Todoist" — Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't catch it.
- **Any.Do:** Voice input struggles with background noise — transcription errors common.
- **Honeydew:** "Add milk, eggs, and bread to the grocery list, remind David to pick them up, and schedule dinner with the Johnsons for Saturday" — Handles all three requests accurately.

**Winner: Honeydew** — Voice control that works in real family environments.

---

### Calendar Integration

| Capability | Todoist | Any.Do | Honeydew |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Built-in calendar | ❌ (view only) | ✅ Native calendar | ✅ Family calendar |
| Google Calendar sync | ✅ One-way | ✅ Two-way | ✅ Two-way |
| Apple Calendar sync | ✅ One-way | ✅ Two-way | ✅ Two-way |
| Family-wide view | ❌ | ⚠️ Limited (4 max) | ✅ Unlimited members |
| Conflict detection | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ AI-powered |
| Attach tasks to events | ❌ | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Full integration |
| Find family availability | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**The Calendar Test:**

"When can all 5 family members have dinner together this week?"

- **Todoist:** Can't answer — doesn't have family calendar access.
- **Any.Do:** Can't answer — limited to 4 members, no family availability feature.
- **Honeydew:** Shows all available time slots, suggests options, lets you schedule with one tap.

**Winner: Honeydew for families. Any.Do for individuals wanting task-calendar integration.**

---

### Task Management

| Capability | Todoist | Any.Do | Honeydew |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Core task management | ✅ **Exceptional** | ✅ Solid | ✅ Good |
| Subtasks | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

| Labels/Tags | ✅ **Extensive** | ✅ Tags | ⚠️ Basic |
| Filters/Views | ✅ **Power user heaven** | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Basic |
| Recurring tasks | ✅ **Natural language** | ✅ Good | ✅ Good |
| Task templates | ✅ 100+ community | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ AI generates instead |
| "My Day" planning | ⚠️ Via filters | ✅ **Dedicated feature** | ⚠️ Via calendar |

**The Task Power Test:**

Create a filtered view showing: "Tasks due this week, priority 1-2, in the Work project, not completed, sorted by due date."

- **Todoist:** `today | overdue, ##Work & (p1 | p2)` — Executes instantly.
- **Any.Do:** Can do basic filtering, but not this specific.
- **Honeydew:** Not designed for this level of individual task filtering.

**Winner: Todoist** — For pure task management power, nothing compares.

---

### Family Architecture

| Capability | Todoist | Any.Do | Honeydew |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Family member limit | Per-seat (unlimited $) | **4 members max** | ✅ **Unlimited** |

| Privacy between groups | N/A | N/A | ✅ Complete isolation |
| Co-parenting support | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Built-in |
| Extended family support | ⚠️ Complex setup | ❌ | ✅ Easy |
| Group switching | N/A | N/A | ✅ <1 second |

**The Family Complexity Test:**

"I need to coordinate: my household (spouse + 3 kids), my ex-spouse (for kids' activities), and my parents (who help with pickups)."

- **Todoist:** Would need multiple accounts, complex sharing, no privacy separation. Not designed for this.
- **Any.Do:** Family plan maxes at 4. Can't even fit your household, let alone extended family.
- **Honeydew:** Create three groups: "Our Household," "Kids - Both Parents," "Grandparents Help." Perfect separation, easy switching.

**Winner: Honeydew** — The only app architectured for modern family complexity.

---

### Integrations & Ecosystem

| Capability | Todoist | Any.Do | Honeydew |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Third-party integrations | ✅ **80+ apps** | ✅ 20+ apps | ⚠️ Core integrations |
| Zapier/IFTTT | ✅ Both | ✅ Both | ⚠️ Coming |
| Slack integration | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Email to task | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Browser extensions | ✅ All browsers | ✅ Major browsers | ⚠️ Limited |
| API for custom integrations | ✅ Full API | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Limited |

**Winner: Todoist** — If your workflow depends on integrations, Todoist is unmatched.

---

### Gamification & Motivation

| Capability | Todoist | Any.Do | Honeydew |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Points system | ✅ **Karma (legendary)** | ⚠️ Basic streaks | ❌ |

### Cost Per Person Per Month

## Real-World Scenarios: Who Wins When?

### Scenario 1: The Solo Productivity Enthusiast

**Profile:** Marcus, 34, software engineer. Reads productivity blogs. Has read Getting Things Done twice. Wants to optimize every aspect of his workflow.

**What Marcus needs:**
- Powerful filtering and organization
- Natural language input (fast task capture)
- Integrations with Slack, GitHub, calendar
- Gamification to stay motivated
- Templates for recurring workflows

**With Todoist:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Marcus is in heaven. Custom filters show exactly what he needs. Natural language input means thoughts become tasks instantly. Karma points motivate completion. 80+ integrations connect his entire digital life. He's built a system that would make David Allen proud.

**With Any.Do:** ⭐⭐⭐
Works fine, but Marcus keeps hitting limitations. Where are the complex filters? Why can't he customize more? The "My Day" feature is nice but not enough.

**With Honeydew:** ⭐⭐
Family features he doesn't need. No Karma points. Fewer integrations. The AI is impressive but overkill for someone who enjoys building systems manually.

**Winner: Todoist** — It was literally designed for Marcus.

---

### Scenario 2: The Budget-Conscious Professional

**Profile:** Elena, 28, freelance designer. Needs task management but watches every dollar. Values simplicity over power features.

**What Elena needs:**
- Task management that works
- Calendar integration
- Affordable pricing
- Intuitive interface (no learning curve)

**With Todoist:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Excellent app, but at $48/year, Elena wonders if she needs all those features. She uses maybe 20% of what Todoist offers.

**With Any.Do:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Perfect fit. $36/year gets her tasks, calendar integration, and the "My Day" planning she loves. Not overwhelming. Does what she needs.

**With Honeydew:** ⭐⭐
$99/year for features designed for families she doesn't have. The AI is impressive but she doesn't need packing lists or soccer schedule coordination.

**Winner: Any.Do** — Right features, right price, right simplicity.

---

### Scenario 3: The Working Parents (Simple Household)

**Profile:** The Chen family. Parents (both working full-time) + 2 kids (ages 7 and 10). Single household, no divorce, no extended family coordination. Need to manage household tasks and kids' schedules.

**What the Chens need:**
- Shared grocery lists
- Kids' activity tracking
- Household task assignment
- Calendar coordination for 4 people

**With Todoist:** ⭐⭐⭐
Can work, but $192/year for 4 accounts adds up. Sharing requires everyone to learn Todoist (kids won't). No family calendar view.

**With Any.Do:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Family plan at $60/year covers all 4. Calendar integration shows everyone's schedule. Shared lists work. Good value for simple household.

**With Honeydew:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
$99/year is more than Any.Do, but the AI makes a real difference. "Create school supply list for 2nd and 4th grader" generates complete lists instantly. Voice control while cooking. Calendar with conflict detection. Worth the $39 difference.

**Winner: Honeydew** — But Any.Do is a solid budget alternative.

---

### Scenario 4: The Complex Modern Family

**Profile:** The Thompson-Davis-Martinez family. Jennifer (mom) divorced from Marcus (dad), now married to Ricardo. Marcus shares custody of twins (age 9). Ricardo has a daughter from previous marriage (12). Jennifer's parents help with pickups. That's potentially 8 people coordinating across 3 households.

**What they need:**
- Coordinate twins across two households (Jennifer + Marcus)
- Keep Ricardo's daughter's schedule visible
- Include grandparents in pickup coordination
- Privacy between households
- Minimal setup for non-tech-savvy grandparents

**With Todoist:** ⭐⭐
This would require: 8 Pro accounts ($384/year), complex project sharing, no privacy separation, and teaching productivity workflows to 75-year-old grandparents. Not realistic.

**With Any.Do:** ⭐
Family plan caps at 4 members. Can't even fit Jennifer's current household (4), let alone coordinate with Marcus's household or grandparents. Fundamentally impossible.

**With Honeydew:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Create separate groups:
- "Twins - Jen & Marcus" (co-parenting coordination)
- "Jennifer's Home" (Jen + Ricardo + twins + stepdaughter)
- "Marcus's Home" (Marcus's household)
- "Grandparents Support" (for pickup coordination)

One tap switches context. Privacy protected. Grandparents just see relevant schedules. $99/year for everyone.

**Winner: Honeydew** — The only app that can handle modern family complexity.

---

### Scenario 5: The Overwhelmed Parent (Mental Load Crisis)

**Profile:** Sarah, 38, carries the "mental load" for her family of 5. Works part-time. Manages calendars, meals, activities, appointments, shopping, and household tasks for everyone. Exhausted from being the family "project manager."

**What Sarah needs:**
- Someone (or something) to share the coordination burden
- Automation that reduces thinking, not just typing
- Voice input when hands are full
- Family members who get clear assignments without learning systems

**With Todoist:** ⭐⭐
Sarah creates beautiful projects and filters. But she's still doing all the thinking. Todoist helps her organize faster, but she's still the only one coordinating. Mental load: unchanged.

**With Any.Do:** ⭐⭐
Similar situation. Nice interface, but Sarah is still manually creating every list, thinking through every schedule conflict, and being the only one who knows what's happening.

**With Honeydew:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Plan birthday party for 8-year-old, 20 guests, at the park" → AI generates venue checklist, supply list, food list, activity schedule, and invitation reminder timeline. Voice add tasks while managing toddler tantrum. Husband gets push notification with specific assigned tasks.

Sarah still coordinates, but the AI handles the "thinking through everything" part. Mental load: noticeably reduced.

**Winner: Honeydew** — The only app that reduces coordination labor, not just organizes it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Which app is "best" overall?**

A: There's no single best—it depends entirely on your use case:
- **Best for individuals:** Todoist
- **Best for budget:** Any.Do
- **Best for families:** Honeydew

**Q: Can I use multiple apps together?**

A: Yes! Many people use Todoist for work productivity and Honeydew for family coordination. Both sync with Google/Apple Calendar, so there's no duplication.

**Q: Which has the best free tier?**

A: Each free tier serves different needs:
- **Todoist Free:** 5 projects, 5 collaborators per project
- **Any.Do Free:** Basic individual features
- **Honeydew Free:** Unlimited family members, 50 AI requests/month

### Feature Questions

**Q: Why doesn't Todoist have a family plan?**

A: Todoist was designed for individual productivity and work teams. "Family" isn't a workspace—it has fundamentally different needs (shared calendars, multi-household coordination, mental load distribution). Adding real family features would require architectural changes.

**Q: Can Any.Do really not support more than 4 family members?**

A: Correct. The family plan caps at 4 total members. Family of 5? One person gets left out. This is a hard limitation in their pricing structure.

**Q: Is Honeydew's AI actually useful, or is it gimmicky?**

A: Try this: Ask Honeydew "Create a packing list for a week-long beach trip with a toddler." In 5-8 seconds, you'll get a comprehensive, categorized list that would take 20+ minutes to create manually. For families, this time savings compounds weekly.

### Pricing Questions

**Q: Is Honeydew worth the extra cost over Any.Do?**

A: For families of 4+, Honeydew is actually comparable or cheaper:
- Any.Do Family: $60/year (4 members max)
- Honeydew Premium: $99/year (unlimited members + AI)

The $39 difference gets you: unlimited members, AI automation, and multi-family support. Most families save that in time within the first month.

**Q: Why is Todoist so expensive for families?**

A: Per-seat pricing. Each family member needs their own Pro account ($4/month). Family of 5 = $240/year just for task management, with no family calendar or AI features.

### Use Case Questions

**Q: I'm a working parent trying to coordinate kids' activities. Which app?**

A: Honeydew. The AI generates activity checklists, the family calendar shows conflicts, and voice control works while multitasking. Todoist and Any.Do would require manual entry of everything.

**Q: I'm a solo professional who sometimes shares grocery lists with my spouse. Which app?**

A: Any.Do or Todoist. You don't need family coordination features—you need individual task management with light sharing. Any.Do is cheaper; Todoist is more powerful.

**Q: I'm divorced and need to coordinate kids across two households. Which app?**

A: Honeydew is the only option with multi-family architecture. Create a "Kids" group that both parents access while keeping separate household groups private.

---

## Migration Considerations

### Switching from Todoist or Any.Do to Honeydew

**What transfers easily:**
- Calendar events (via Google/Apple Calendar sync)
- Basic task concepts (recreate key lists)
- Family member invitations

**What requires recreation:**
- Complex project structures (different architecture)
- Labels, filters, and custom views
- Karma/gamification history

**Recommended approach:**
- Week 1-2: Run both apps (Honeydew for family, existing app for personal)
- Week 3: Evaluate which you reach for more
- Week 4: Decide whether to consolidate or keep both

### Using Multiple Apps (Common Pattern)

Many users find the best solution is:
- **Todoist** for individual work productivity
- **Honeydew** for family coordination
- **Google Calendar** syncing between both

This gives you power user features for work AND family-first features at home.

---

## The Bottom Line: Our Recommendations

### For Individuals (No Family Coordination Needed)

**Primary recommendation: Todoist ($48/year)**

**Budget alternative: Any.Do ($36/year)**

Why: Most the functionality at 75% of the price. If you don't need advanced filters or Karma, Any.Do delivers solid value.

### For Couples / Small Households

**Budget priority: Any.Do Family ($60/year)**

Why: Covers up to 4 members with integrated calendar. Simple, affordable, works.

**Feature priority: Honeydew Premium ($99/year)**

Why: AI assistance saves time, voice control adds flexibility, and you're future-proofed if family grows.

### For Families of 4+

**Primary recommendation: Honeydew Premium ($99/year)**
