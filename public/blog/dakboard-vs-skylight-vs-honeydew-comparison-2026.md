# DAKboard vs Skylight vs Honeydew: DIY vs Premium vs AI — Which Approach Is Best for Your Family?

**Quick Answer:** These three represent fundamentally different approaches to family calendars. **DAKboard** = DIY project for tech enthusiasts ($100-300 + 8+ hours setup). **Skylight** = plug-and-play premium hardware ($299-$499 + subscription). **Honeydew** = AI-powered software that works everywhere ($0-$95/year, no hardware needed). Choose **DAKboard** if you love tinkering and want complete customization. Choose **Skylight** if you want beautiful hardware without technical work. Choose **Honeydew** if you want AI to actually *help* with coordination—not just display it.

## Understanding the Three Approaches

Before diving into details, let's understand what each approach actually means:

### DAKboard: The DIY Philosophy

DAKboard is a **cloud-based dashboard service** designed to display calendars, weather, photos, and more on a screen you provide. Most users run it on:

- Raspberry Pi ($35-80) + monitor ($50-200)
- Old tablet or laptop
- Any computer with a web browser

**The appeal:** Total control, customization, and the satisfaction of building something yourself.

**The reality:** It's a project, not a product. You're signing up for ongoing maintenance, troubleshooting, and updates.

### Skylight: The Premium Hardware Philosophy

Skylight is a **dedicated family display** designed specifically for calendar viewing. You buy the hardware, mount it, and connect it to your calendars.

**The appeal:** Beautiful, purpose-built hardware that "just works."

**The reality:** You're paying premium prices for a display-only device with no AI or voice capabilities.

### Honeydew: The AI Software Philosophy

Honeydew is a **family coordination platform** that uses AI to actually help with planning—not just displaying calendars.

**The appeal:** AI handles the coordination work, works on devices you already own, and costs less than hardware options.

**The reality:** No dedicated wall display (though you can mount a tablet), and requires internet connectivity.

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Planning a Family Vacation

**With DAKboard:**
1. Create vacation event in Google Calendar
2. Display shows the event on your wall
3. Open a separate notes app for packing list
4. Manually type 50+ packing items
5. Share list via text/email
6. Track what's packed separately
7. **Result:** Wall shows you're going on vacation. Zero help with planning.

**With Skylight:**
1. Create vacation event (on phone or display)
2. Display shows the event beautifully
3. Create packing list... wait, Skylight doesn't do lists
4. Open Cozi or Notes app for packing
5. **Result:** Pretty display, same manual work as before

**With Honeydew:**
1. Say: "Plan our beach trip to Outer Banks, August 10-15, family of 4 with kids ages 6 and 9"
2. Honeydew creates:
   - ✅ Calendar event with location
   - ✅ Packing list (swimsuits, sunscreen, beach toys—age-appropriate)
   - ✅ Pre-trip checklist (stop mail, pet sitter, water plants)
   - ✅ Activity suggestions based on kids' ages
3. List is attached to the trip event
4. Voice-add items as you think of them: "Add boogie boards to the beach packing list"
5. **Result:** 5 minutes vs 45 minutes. AI does the coordination work.

### Scenario 2: Weekly Family Coordination

**With DAKboard:**
- **Sunday night:** Log into Google Calendar, manually add soccer practice (Tue 5pm), dance class (Wed 4pm), dentist (Fri 2pm), birthday party (Sat 11am)
- **During week:** Check wall display to see what's coming
- **Friday:** Realize you forgot to RSVP for birthday party, scramble to find gift
- **Result:** Display worked, but you still did all the coordination manually

**With Skylight:**
- **Sunday night:** Add events via phone or tapping display
- **During week:** Glance at beautiful wall calendar
- **Friday:** Same RSVP/gift scramble
- **Result:** Prettier display, same outcome

**With Honeydew:**
- **Sunday night:** Say "Add this week: soccer Tuesday 5pm, dance Wednesday 4pm, dentist Friday 2pm, Jack's birthday party Saturday at 11am, need to RSVP"
- **Honeydew:** Creates all events, adds RSVP reminder for Tuesday, creates gift shopping task
- **Tuesday:** Notification: "RSVP for Jack's birthday party"
- **Thursday:** Notification: "Pick up birthday gift for Jack"
- **Saturday:** Notification with party address and time
- **Result:** AI handled the coordination. You just showed up.

### Scenario 3: Divorced Parents Coordinating

**With DAKboard:**
- Create shared Google Calendar for kids
- Each parent views on separate DAKboard displays
- Manual text coordination for changes
- No privacy for personal calendars
- **Constant issue:** "Did you see I updated the calendar?" "No, mine hasn't refreshed"

**With Skylight:**
- **Not supported.** Skylight is single-household only.
- Workaround: Both parents have Skylight app, but no real multi-family architecture
- No privacy separation between households

**With Honeydew:**
- Create "Kids - Mom & Dad" shared family group
- Each parent also has private household group
- Kids' events visible to both parents instantly
- Changes sync in <50ms (real-time)
- Private calendars stay private
- Built-in co-parenting features (handoff notes, schedule visibility)
- **Result:** Purpose-built for modern family structures

## FAQ: DAKboard vs Skylight vs Honeydew

### Setup & Technical

**Q: How hard is DAKboard to set up for a non-technical person?**

A: Very hard. DAKboard itself is straightforward, but setting up a Raspberry Pi, configuring kiosk mode, preventing sleep mode, handling WiFi reconnection, and maintaining the system requires technical knowledge. If you've never used command line, expect 20+ hours of learning and frustration. Budget for ongoing maintenance time too.

**Q: Can I add Alexa/Google Home voice control to DAKboard?**

A: Not directly. You could set up a parallel system where Alexa adds events to Google Calendar, which then syncs to DAKboard, but there's no native integration. It's a workaround, not a feature.

**Q: Does Skylight work with Apple Calendar?**

A: Yes, but with limitations. Skylight can display Apple/iCloud calendars (one-way sync). Changes made on Skylight don't sync back to Apple Calendar. This is a significant limitation for Apple-household families.

**Q: Can Honeydew work as a wall display?**

A: Yes. Mount any tablet (iPad, Fire Tablet, old Android) on your wall, install Honeydew, and enable kiosk mode. You get wall display functionality PLUS AI, voice, and two-way sync—for less money than Skylight.

### Features & Functionality

**Q: Which has the best AI features?**

A: Honeydew is the only option with AI. DAKboard and Skylight have zero AI capabilities—they display what you manually enter. Honeydew's AI can generate packing lists, suggest activities, detect scheduling conflicts, and create meal plans from a single sentence prompt.

**Q: Can DAKboard show photos like Skylight?**

A: Yes. DAKboard has excellent photo display capabilities, including integration with Google Photos, Flickr, and local storage. This is one area where DAKboard matches or exceeds Skylight—if you invest the setup time.

**Q: Does Skylight have voice control?**

A: No. Despite being a $300+ device, Skylight has no voice input. You must tap the screen or use the phone app to make any changes.

**Q: Which is best for divorced parents?**

A: Honeydew, by a wide margin. It's the only one with multi-family architecture that supports separate households with shared children's calendars. DAKboard requires complex manual configuration. Skylight simply doesn't support multi-household scenarios.

### Cost & Value

**Q: Is DAKboard really cheaper?**

A: Not when you factor in time. Hardware costs $100-300, but setup and maintenance require 15-40+ hours per year. At $25/hour, that's $375-1,000 annually in time value. Skylight at $300 + $79/year is actually cheaper when time is factored in. Honeydew is cheapest overall at $0-95/year with zero maintenance time.

**Q: Why is Skylight so expensive for what it does?**

A: You're paying for:
1. Purpose-built hardware with premium display
2. Industrial design and aesthetics
3. Zero-maintenance experience
4. Customer support

Is it worth it? That depends on how much you value dedicated hardware aesthetics vs features. For display-only functionality, it's expensive. For "beautiful kitchen calendar that just works," it's fairly priced.

**Q: Is Honeydew's free tier actually useful?**

A: Yes. The free tier includes unlimited family members, calendar sync, lists, and 50 AI requests/month. Many families find this sufficient. The paid tier ($7.99/month or $79/year) adds unlimited AI requests and premium features, but free tier is genuinely functional.

### Comparisons

**Q: Can I use DAKboard with Honeydew?**

A: Partially. Honeydew syncs with Google Calendar two-way. DAKboard displays Google Calendar. So Honeydew's calendar changes would appear on DAKboard. However, you'd lose Honeydew's lists, AI features, and voice control on the display—only calendar events would show.

**Q: Should I get Skylight AND Honeydew?**

A: You could, but it's redundant. Better approach: Mount a cheap tablet, install Honeydew, and you get wall display + AI + voice for less than Skylight alone. Skylight's main value is the hardware aesthetics—if that's not important, skip it.

**Q: What if I want DAKboard's customization with AI features?**

A: This combination doesn't exist currently. DAKboard is display-only with no AI. Honeydew is AI-first with standard app interface. If you want deep visual customization AND AI, your best option is Honeydew for coordination + DAKboard for display (accepting they won't fully integrate).

### Privacy & Security

**Q: Which is safest for family data?**

A: All three handle calendar data, which is inherently sensitive:

- **DAKboard:** Data security depends on your setup. Self-hosted = you control it. Cloud = trust DAKboard's infrastructure.
- **Skylight:** Standard cloud security. Data encrypted in transit.
- **Honeydew:** Data encrypted in transit and at rest. Standard startup security practices.

All three are reasonably secure for family calendar data. None have had significant security incidents.

**Q: Does Honeydew's AI read all my calendar data?**

A: Honeydew's AI processes your calendar data to provide planning assistance—that's how it works. If you're uncomfortable with AI accessing your family's schedule, Honeydew isn't for you. However, data is encrypted and not shared externally.

## The Bottom Line: Our Recommendation

### For Most Families: Honeydew

**Honeydew wins for 80% of families** because:

1. **AI actually helps** — It doesn't just display your calendar; it helps coordinate
2. **Voice control works** — 96.3% accuracy means it's actually usable while multitasking
3. **Multi-family support** — Critical for divorced parents, grandparents, blended families
4. **Lowest cost** — Free tier is functional; paid tier is cheaper than hardware options
5. **Zero maintenance** — No troubleshooting, no updates to manage
6. **Portable** — Your family coordination travels with you

**The wall display objection:** "But I want to see the calendar on my wall!"

**Answer:** Mount a $100 tablet. Install Honeydew. You now have wall display + AI + voice for less than Skylight—with more features.

### For DIY Enthusiasts: DAKboard

**DAKboard wins for tinkerers** because:

1. **Complete customization** — Pixel-perfect control over every element
2. **Project satisfaction** — Building it is part of the reward
3. **Integration flexibility** — Connect anything with APIs
4. **Learning experience** — Great intro to Raspberry Pi, Linux, home automation

**Be honest:** Choose DAKboard because you WANT to build it, not because you think you should. If you're choosing DAKboard to "save money," you won't—Honeydew is cheaper and requires zero maintenance.

### For Premium Hardware Seekers: Skylight

**Skylight wins for aesthetics** because:

1. **Beautiful, dedicated hardware** — Looks great in any kitchen
2. **Zero technical work** — Unbox, mount, connect, done
3. **Established, reliable** — Proven product since 2019
4. **Photo display** — Doubles as digital frame

**The trade-off:** You're paying $500+ over 5 years for a display-only device with no AI, no voice, and no multi-family support. If that's okay with you, Skylight delivers.
