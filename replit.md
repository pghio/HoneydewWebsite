# Honeydew Marketing Website

## Overview

Created a modern marketing website for the Honeydew family management app featuring tasteful animations and comprehensive showcase of use cases. The website transforms visitors through an engaging journey highlighting how Honeydew revolutionizes family life, friendships, group adventures, productivity, home management, and special occasions. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for smooth animations.

## System Architecture

### Marketing Website Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Animation Library**: Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients and animations
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Component Organization**: Modern component architecture with reusable sections

### Backend Architecture
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth integration
- **Real-time Database**: Firebase Firestore for data synchronization
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage for attachments and media
- **API Layer**: Custom hooks for data fetching and mutations
- **AI Integration**: Modular 8-stage AI pipeline for intelligent list creation

### Database Schema
The application uses Firestore with the following main collections:
- **users**: User profiles and preferences
- **families**: Family group information and settings
- **lists**: Shared and personal lists with items
- **events**: Calendar events and scheduling
- **ai_processing_attempts**: AI processing audit trail
- **ai_generated_lists**: AI-created list metadata
- **ai_user_patterns**: User behavior patterns for AI enhancement

## Key Components

### Component Structure
```
/client/src/components/
├── Shared/                 # Centralized shared components
│   ├── common/            # UI primitives (Button, Input, Card, Dialog)
│   ├── auth/              # Authentication components
│   └── navigation/        # Navigation components
├── Calendar/              # Calendar feature components
├── Lists/                 # List management components
└── Home/                  # Home and family management
```

### Core Features
1. **Calendar Management**: Month, week, and day views with event scheduling
2. **List Management**: Personal and shared lists with AI-powered creation
3. **Family Coordination**: Multi-user family groups with role-based permissions
4. **Authentication**: Secure user authentication with guest access
5. **AI Assistant**: Natural language list creation with intelligent suggestions

### Import System
The application uses a modern import system with:
- **Absolute imports** using `@/` alias
- **Barrel exports** for component consolidation
- **Centralized shared components** in `/Shared/` directory

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. Users can access most features without authentication
2. Family features require sign-in through welcome modal
3. Settings stored in localStorage for guests, synced to profile when authenticated
4. Firebase Auth handles secure authentication and session management

### List Management Flow
1. **Creation**: Direct input or AI-powered natural language processing
2. **AI Pipeline**: 8-stage processing (Input → Intent → Entity → Organization → Template → Enhancement → Privacy → Output)
3. **Storage**: Real-time sync to Firestore with offline support
4. **Sharing**: Family-based permissions and real-time collaboration

### Calendar Integration
1. Events created from list items with due dates
2. Multiple view formats (month, week, day)
3. All-day and timed event support
4. Cross-family event visibility and coordination

## External Dependencies
