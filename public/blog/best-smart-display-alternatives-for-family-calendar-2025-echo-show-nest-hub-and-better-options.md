# Best Smart Display Alternatives for Family Calendar 2025: Echo Show, Nest Hub, and Better Options

**Quick Answer:** For a smart display family calendar, you have three options: **dedicated displays** (Skylight, Hearth), **smart home displays** (Echo Show, Nest Hub), or **tablet + app** (iPad with Honeydew). The **best value** is a tablet with an AI family app—you get voice control, AI features, AND a display for similar or lower cost than dedicated hardware. Here's how they compare.

| Option | Cost | AI Features | Voice | Multi-Family | Best For |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Echo Show 15** | $250 | ⚠️ Alexa only | ✅ | ❌ | Alexa households |
| **Nest Hub Max** | $230 | ⚠️ Google only | ✅ | ❌ | Google households |
| **Skylight Calendar** | $299+ | ❌ None | ❌ | ❌ | Simple display |
| **iPad + Honeydew** | $250-400 | ✅ Full AI | ✅ | ✅ | Modern families |

## The Family Calendar Display Market

Families want a central display showing the family calendar. The options have expanded:

1. **Dedicated family displays:** Skylight ($299), Hearth ($549+)
2. **Smart home displays:** Echo Show ($90-250), Nest Hub ($100-230)
3. **Repurposed tablets:** iPad/Android + family app

Each has trade-offs. Let's break them down.

---

## Option 1: Amazon Echo Show (Alexa-Powered)

### Echo Show 15 ($249.99)
**The flagship:** 15.6" display, wall-mountable, Alexa voice control

#### What It Does Well

✅ **Always-on display** — Shows calendar when not in use
✅ **Alexa voice control** — "Alexa, what's on the calendar today?"
✅ **Widget-based home screen** — Calendar, weather, reminders, photos
✅ **Smart home hub** — Control lights, cameras, locks
✅ **Familiar ecosystem** — Works with existing Alexa devices
✅ **Photo frame mode** — Display family photos

#### Family Calendar Limitations

❌ **Alexa calendar only** — Limited to Alexa-compatible calendars
❌ **No AI family features** — Can't generate packing lists, coordinate tasks
❌ **Single household** — No multi-family group support
❌ **Basic voice commands** — "Add event" but not "plan our vacation"
❌ **No lists attached to events** — Calendar and lists are separate
❌ **No learning** — Doesn't get smarter over time

#### Pricing
- Echo Show 15: $249.99
- Echo Show 10: $249.99 (rotating screen)
- Echo Show 8: $149.99
- Echo Show 5: $89.99

### Best For
Families already deep in the **Alexa ecosystem** who want a smart home hub that happens to show calendar.

### Not Ideal For
Families needing true AI family coordination, divorced parent support, or lists integrated with calendar events.

---

## Option 2: Google Nest Hub (Google-Powered)

### Nest Hub Max ($229.99)
**Google's flagship:** 10" display, Google Assistant, smart home control

#### What It Does Well

✅ **Google Calendar native** — Best calendar integration
✅ **Google Assistant** — "Hey Google, what's on my calendar?"
✅ **Nest camera integration** — See doorbell, baby monitor
✅ **YouTube/streaming** — Media playback
✅ **Photo frame** — Google Photos integration
✅ **Face Match** — Personalized results by family member

#### Family Calendar Limitations

❌ **No AI family features** — Google Calendar AI is basic
❌ **Single household** — No multi-family coordination
❌ **No voice-driven list generation** — Can't "create packing list for vacation"
❌ **Lists and calendar separate** — Google Tasks ≠ Calendar events
❌ **Smaller screen** — 10" max (vs 15" Echo Show 15)

#### Pricing
- Nest Hub Max: $229.99 (10")
- Nest Hub (2nd gen): $99.99 (7")

### Best For
Families in the **Google ecosystem** who want smart home control with calendar viewing.

### Not Ideal For
Families needing AI-powered family coordination beyond basic calendar display.

## The Smart Home Integration Question

**"But Echo Show controls my smart home. Can Honeydew do that?"**

**Honest answer:** No, Honeydew isn't a smart home controller.

**But consider:**
- Is smart home control your PRIMARY need, or calendar/coordination?
- You can have BOTH: Echo Show for smart home + tablet for family coordination
- Many families have multiple devices anyway

**If smart home is priority:** Echo Show or Nest Hub
**If family coordination is priority:** Tablet + Honeydew

## FAQ: Smart Display Family Calendar

### Can Echo Show sync with Google Calendar?

Yes, via skill/integration. But it's limited compared to native Google Calendar on Nest Hub.

### Can Nest Hub show Apple Calendar?

Limited. Google ecosystem works best with Google Calendar. Apple Calendar sync is basic.

### Is a tablet more expensive than Echo Show?

**Not necessarily.** 
- Echo Show 15: $250
- Budget Android tablet: $150-200

The tablet offers more functionality and portability.

### Can I use Siri/Google Assistant on the tablet?

Yes, in addition to Honeydew's voice features. You get multiple voice options.

### What if my family already has Skylight?

You can keep using it! Add Honeydew on your phones for AI features, lists, and multi-family coordination. They complement each other.

### Does Honeydew work offline?

Basic features work offline. AI features and sync require internet (like all smart displays).

### Can grandparents use a tablet family display?

Yes, and better than smart home displays. Touch interface is intuitive. Honeydew is designed to be simple.
