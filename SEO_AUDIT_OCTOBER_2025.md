2. **Indexing Problem:** Even if Google finds posts, they're not optimized
   - Missing canonical URLs ‚Üí duplicate content risk

3. **Trust Problem:** New domain with minimal authority

### Expected Timeline (After Fixes)

**Week 1-2:** Google discovers and crawls sitemap

**Month 4-6:** Rankings stabilize (positions 5-20) for long-tail keywords

## Questions to Consider

1. **Do you want to index future-dated articles now?**
   - Pro: Google can crawl immediately, start ranking before publish date
   - Con: Users might find articles "early" via direct URL access
   - Recommendation: Include in sitemap but keep date-filtering in BlogListPage

2. **Should we create category/tag pages?**
   - Pro: Additional entry points for SEO
   - Con: More dev work, thinner content per page
   - Recommendation: Wait until 20+ articles published

3. **Newsletter integration?**
   - Pro: Build email list, distribute content directly
   - Con: Additional tool/cost
   - Recommendation: Add Substack embed or ConvertKit form

4. **Comments on blog posts?**
   - Pro: User-generated content, engagement signals
   - Con: Moderation burden, spam risk
   - Recommendation: Start without, add later if traffic justifies
