# Honeydew vs Mango Display: Family Calendar Showdown 2026

## Quick Answer

**Mango Display or Honeydew?** Honeydew is the better choice for most families in 2026. While Mango Display offers an attractive wall-mounted touchscreen calendar ($499+ hardware), it lacks AI capabilities, voice control, and can only be accessed from one location. Honeydew delivers an AI agent with 27+ tools, 96.3% accurate voice control, multi-family support, and works on every device you own—all for $79/year instead of $500+ upfront.

**The core difference:** Mango Display is a calendar you look at. Honeydew is an AI assistant that actually plans, coordinates, and reduces your mental load.

**Bottom line:** Unless you specifically need a dedicated kitchen touchscreen and have budget to spare, Honeydew provides 10x more family coordination value at 1/6th the cost.

## What is Mango Display?

Mango Display is a **wall-mounted touchscreen device** designed specifically for family calendar coordination. Launched in 2022, it's part of a growing category of dedicated family displays that also includes Skylight Calendar and Hearth Display.

The concept is simple: mount a sleek touchscreen in your kitchen or high-traffic area where everyone can see the family schedule at a glance. It's essentially a digital replacement for the paper calendar on your refrigerator.

### Mango Display's Target Market

Mango positions itself for families who:
- Want a dedicated, always-visible calendar hub
- Prefer touchscreen interaction over phone apps
- Are willing to invest in premium hardware
- Value aesthetic design in their home

### Mango Display's Key Features

- **Touchscreen Interface:** 15" or larger display with intuitive touch controls
- **Calendar Aggregation:** Import calendars from Google, Apple, Outlook
- **Family Member Profiles:** Color-coded schedules for each person
- **Chore Charts:** Basic task assignment features
- **Photo Display:** Slideshow mode when not actively viewing calendar
- **Wall Mount Design:** Sleek hardware that blends with home décor
- **Companion App:** Limited mobile viewing (but not full functionality)

### Mango Display's Pricing

- **Hardware:** ~$499 for the touchscreen display
- **Subscription:** Additional monthly/annual fee for premium features
- **Total First Year:** $500–$600+
- **Ongoing Cost:** Subscription continues after year one
- **Additional Costs:** Wall mounting, potential repairs, replacement if hardware fails

### Mango Display's Limitations

Before we dive deep, here are Mango Display's notable gaps:

1. **No AI Planning:** Cannot understand natural language or create plans automatically
2. **No Voice Control:** 100% manual touch input required
3. **Single Location:** Stuck on your wall—useless when traveling, at work, or grocery shopping
4. **No Two-Way Sync:** Changes in Mango may not flow back to Google/Apple Calendar
5. **Single Household:** No multi-family architecture for co-parenting or extended family
6. **Hardware Dependency:** If the screen breaks, you're out $500+
7. **Newer Company:** Less established than alternatives, potential longevity concerns

---

## What is Honeydew?

Honeydew is an **AI-powered family organization app** that transforms family coordination through intelligent automation. Rather than being a calendar you look at, Honeydew is an AI assistant that actively helps plan, organize, and coordinate your family life.

### The Software vs Hardware Philosophy

Where Mango Display bets on dedicated hardware, Honeydew bets on intelligent software that works on devices you already own. The result: more features, more flexibility, lower cost.

### Honeydew's Key Features

- **AI Agent with 27+ Tools:** Natural language task creation, intelligent scheduling, conflict detection, automated planning
- **Voice Control:** Whisper AI transcription with 96.3% accuracy—add items while cooking, driving, or wrangling kids
- **Two-Way Calendar Sync:** Real bidirectional sync with Google and Apple Calendar every 15 minutes
- **Multi-Family Architecture:** Unlimited family groups with instant switching (divorced parents, extended family, friend groups)
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** <50ms WebSocket latency for instant family updates
- **OCR Image Processing:** Photograph handwritten notes, school papers, permission slips—AI extracts and organizes
- **Knowledge Graph Learning:** 80% cache hit rate means personalized, faster responses over time
- **Lists Attached to Events:** Connect packing lists, shopping lists, and tasks directly to calendar events

### Honeydew's Pricing

- **Free Tier:** Unlimited family members, basic AI features, calendar sync
- **Premium:** $7.99/month or $79/year (save 17%)
- **No Hardware Purchase:** Works on phones, tablets, computers you already own
- **No Per-User Fees:** Add unlimited family members at no extra cost

## Feature Comparison: Mango Display vs Honeydew

### AI & Automation: Intelligence vs Static Display

**The fundamental difference:** Honeydew thinks and plans. Mango Display shows what you've already entered.

**Mango Display's Approach:**
Mango Display has **zero AI capabilities**. It's a display device that:
- Shows calendar events you've manually added elsewhere
- Requires you to tap, type, and input everything yourself
- Cannot suggest, plan, or automate anything
- Treats family coordination as a display problem, not a planning problem

**Honeydew's AI Agent:**
Honeydew's AI includes 27+ specialized tools trained for family coordination:

| AI Capability | What It Does | Mango Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Natural Language Processing** | "Plan camping trip next month" → creates event, packing list, reminders | None (manual entry) |
| **Smart Scheduling** | Analyzes calendars to find optimal times | None (you figure it out) |
| **Conflict Detection** | "Warning: Soccer overlaps with dentist" | None (you notice... maybe) |
| **Task Decomposition** | Complex requests → actionable steps | None (you break it down) |
| **Meal Planning** | Generate weekly menus with grocery lists | None |
| **List Generation** | AI creates comprehensive packing/shopping lists | None |
| **Learning System** | Remembers your preferences (80% cache hit) | None |

**Real Example:**

> **You say to Honeydew:** "Plan our beach trip next Saturday with packing list"
>
> **Honeydew AI Response (5 seconds):**
> - ✅ Creates calendar event "Beach Trip" for Saturday
> - ✅ Generates comprehensive packing list (sunscreen, towels, snacks, toys, first aid)
> - ✅ Adds weather forecast check reminder
> - ✅ Creates shopping list for items you might need
> - ✅ Notifies all family members
>
> **Time saved:** 20+ minutes of manual planning

> **Same task with Mango Display:**
> - Walk to wall display
> - Tap through menus to create event
> - Type "Beach Trip"
> - Create separate list manually (in a different app?)
> - Text family members separately
> - Remember packing items from memory (you'll forget things)
>
> **Time required:** 25-30 minutes + forgotten items

**Winner: Honeydew** — Mango Display doesn't attempt this category. It's comparing a calculator to a full computer.

---

### Voice Control: Hands-Free vs Hands-Required

**Why voice matters for families:** You're cooking dinner, kids are screaming, you remember you need milk. Can you add it to the list?

**Mango Display's Voice Capability:**
**None.** Mango Display requires physical touch interaction. If you're:
- Cooking with wet/dirty hands
- Holding a baby
- Driving (obviously can't use wall display anyway)
- In another room

...you cannot interact with Mango Display. You must walk to the display, tap the screen, navigate menus, and type your input.

**Honeydew's Voice Control:**
Honeydew uses OpenAI's Whisper AI—the industry gold standard for speech recognition:

| Voice Feature | Honeydew | Mango Display |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **Accuracy** | 96.3% (Whisper AI) | N/A (no voice) |
| **Languages** | 58 languages | N/A |
| **Noise Tolerance** | Works in busy environments | N/A |
| **Complex Commands** | "Add soccer practice Tuesdays at 4pm starting next week" | N/A |
| **Multi-Step Requests** | "Plan birthday party for Emma with guest list and shopping list" | N/A |
| **While Driving** | ✅ Safe, legal hands-free | ❌ Wall is at home |
| **While Cooking** | ✅ No touching required | ❌ Must touch screen |

**Voice Command Examples:**
- "Add milk, eggs, and bread to grocery list" (hands are dirty)
- "Schedule dentist for both kids next Thursday at 3pm" (driving)
- "What's on our calendar this weekend?" (across the room)
- "Create packing list for ski trip" (folding laundry)
- "Remind me to RSVP to Jake's party by Friday" (running out the door)

**Winner: Honeydew** — You can't compete with voice control when you have no voice control.

---

### Calendar Integration: Two-Way vs One-Way

**The sync problem:** Most families use Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or both. How well does each solution integrate?

**Mango Display's Calendar Sync:**
- **Import-Only:** Pulls events from external calendars
- **One-Way Direction:** External → Mango only
- **Manual Updates:** Events added in Mango may not sync back
- **Sync Delays:** Not real-time; varies by source
- **Result:** You end up with two sources of truth, which defeats the purpose

The fundamental problem: if you add an event on Mango Display, your spouse checking Google Calendar on their phone might not see it. This creates coordination gaps—exactly what you bought the device to solve.

**Honeydew's Calendar Sync:**
- **True Two-Way Sync:** Changes flow both directions
- **Google Calendar:** Full bidirectional integration
- **Apple Calendar:** Full bidirectional integration  
- **15-Minute Intervals:** Near-real-time synchronization
- **Conflict Detection:** AI identifies double-bookings automatically
- **Single Source of Truth:** Edit anywhere, see everywhere

**Why Two-Way Matters:**

| Scenario | Honeydew | Mango Display |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Add event in Honeydew | ✅ Appears in Google/Apple | N/A |
| Add event in Google Calendar | ✅ Appears in Honeydew | ✅ Appears on display |
| Edit event in Honeydew | ✅ Updates Google/Apple | N/A |
| Edit event on display | N/A | ⚠️ May not sync back |

**Winner: Honeydew** — Two-way sync is essential for real family coordination.

### Accessibility & Portability: Everywhere vs One Wall

**The location problem:** Where do you need your family calendar?

**Mango Display's Accessibility:**
- **Fixed Location:** Mounted on one wall in your home
- **Zero Portability:** Cannot take it with you
- **Useless When Away:** At work, grocery store, school pickup, vacation? Your calendar is on a wall at home.
- **Single Room:** Not helpful when you're in the bedroom, backyard, or garage
- **Limited Mobile App:** Basic viewing, not full functionality

**Where Mango Display Can't Help:**
- ❌ At work coordinating pickup with spouse
- ❌ At grocery store checking what you need
- ❌ At doctor's office scheduling follow-up
- ❌ In the car coordinating with spouse
- ❌ At kids' school checking the schedule
- ❌ On vacation planning activities
- ❌ At parents' house coordinating holidays

**Honeydew's Accessibility:**
- **Works Everywhere:** Phone, tablet, computer, any web browser
- **Full Features on Mobile:** Not a "companion app"—the real thing
- **Offline Capability:** Core features work without internet
- **Cross-Device Sync:** Start on phone, continue on computer
- **DIY Wall Display:** Mount any tablet running Honeydew for same visual effect

**Where Honeydew Helps:**
- ✅ Add items from anywhere, anytime
- ✅ Coordinate with spouse from work
- ✅ Check schedule at grocery store
- ✅ Voice-add while driving safely
- ✅ Full functionality on vacation
- ✅ Works on everyone's devices simultaneously

**Winner: Honeydew** — A calendar stuck on your wall is only useful when you're looking at that wall.

### Multi-Family Support: Modern Families vs Traditional Model

**The modern family challenge:** 40%+ of American families don't fit the "one household, two parents" model. What about divorced parents? Extended family coordination? Friend groups?

**Mango Display's Family Architecture:**
- **Single Household Only:** Designed for one family unit
- **No Multi-Family:** Cannot manage separate family groups
- **Co-Parenting Problem:** Would need two displays ($1,000+) that still can't coordinate
- **Extended Family:** No way to include grandparents without giving them full access
- **No Privacy Controls:** Everyone sees everything

**Real Problem for Divorced Parents:**
If parents share custody, they need to coordinate across two households. With Mango Display:
- Parent A has display at their house ($500)
- Parent B needs separate display at their house ($500)  
- Two systems that can't talk to each other
- Kids' schedules exist in two places, creating conflicts
- **Total cost: $1,000+ and it still doesn't solve the problem**

**Honeydew's Multi-Family Architecture:**
Purpose-built for modern family complexity:

| Multi-Family Feature | Honeydew | Mango Display |
|---------------------|----------|---------------|
| **Unlimited Groups** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Instant Switching** | ✅ <1 second | ❌ |
| **Privacy by Default** | ✅ Groups don't see each other | ❌ |
| **Shared Kids Group** | ✅ Both parents coordinate | ❌ |
| **Extended Family** | ✅ Separate group | ❌ |
| **Friend Groups** | ✅ Carpool, teams, trips | ❌ |

**How Honeydew Handles Co-Parenting:**
- "Kids - Mom & Dad" group: Both parents coordinate custody, activities, school events
- "Mom's Household" group: Just her home's internal tasks
- "Dad's Household" group: Just his home's internal tasks
- Kids can be in all three groups, see everything relevant to them
- **Total cost: $79/year for everyone**

**Winner: Honeydew** — Mango Display's single-family architecture is a dealbreaker for modern family structures.

### Photo Recognition (OCR): Smart Capture vs Manual Entry

**The paper problem:** Kids bring home permission slips, doctors give you appointment cards, recipes exist on paper. How do you digitize them?

**Mango Display's OCR:**
None. If you receive a paper schedule, permission slip, or handwritten note, you must:
1. Read the paper manually
2. Walk to the display
3. Navigate to add event
4. Type all information by hand
5. Hope you didn't make typos

**Honeydew's OCR Capability:**
Photograph any paper → AI extracts and organizes automatically:

- **Permission Slips:** Photo → Honeydew extracts date, event, required items, creates calendar event + checklist
- **Appointment Cards:** Photo → Event created with correct date/time/location
- **Handwritten Lists:** Photo → Converted to editable digital list
- **School Schedules:** Photo → Multiple events created and organized
- **Recipes:** Photo → Ingredients become shopping list items

**Example Workflow:**
> Kid brings home field trip permission slip
>
> **With Mango Display:**
> - Read slip (2 min)
> - Walk to display, tap through menus (1 min)
> - Type event name, date, time (2 min)
> - Try to remember required items (ongoing)
> - Text spouse about it (2 min)
> - **Total: 7+ minutes, plus forgotten items**
>
> **With Honeydew:**
> - Photograph slip (3 seconds)
> - AI extracts: "Science Museum Field Trip, March 15, 9am, bring lunch + $10"
> - Creates event + checklist automatically
> - Family notified instantly
> - **Total: 10 seconds**

**Winner: Honeydew** — OCR eliminates an entire category of manual data entry.

---

### Lists & Planning: Comprehensive vs Basic

**Mango Display's List Features:**
- Basic chore chart functionality
- Limited or no grocery list integration
- Cannot attach lists to calendar events
- No AI-generated lists
- Manual entry for everything

**Honeydew's List Features:**
- **Unlimited Lists:** Grocery, packing, to-do, gift, project, household, etc.
- **AI-Generated Lists:** "Create camping packing list" → comprehensive list appears
- **Attached to Events:** Beach trip event has packing list attached directly
- **Collaborative Editing:** Multiple people edit simultaneously in real-time
- **Smart Suggestions:** AI learns what you typically pack/buy
- **Template Library:** Reuse lists for recurring trips/events
- **Cross-Device:** Access lists anywhere

**Winner: Honeydew** — Lists are fundamental to family coordination; Mango Display treats them as an afterthought.

---

## The Touchscreen Appeal: Understanding Mango Display's Strengths

Let's be fair: Mango Display exists because the concept of a dedicated wall display has genuine appeal.

### Why Some Families Choose Wall Displays

**1. Visual Presence**
A wall-mounted display is always visible in high-traffic areas. You literally cannot miss it when walking through your kitchen. For families who struggle to check their phones, this passive visibility can help.

**2. Shared Family Interface**
Unlike phones (personal devices), a wall display is a shared space. Everyone can gather around it, kids can check their schedule independently, and it becomes a focal point for family coordination.

**3. Reduced Phone Dependence**
Some parents want their kids to engage with schedules without handing them a smartphone. A wall display provides calendar access without the distractions of apps, games, and social media.

**4. Aesthetic Appeal**
High-quality displays like Mango can look beautiful in a modern kitchen. They feel like premium home tech, not utilitarian tools.

**5. Digital Photo Frame**
When not actively displaying calendar info, these devices can show family photos—a nice bonus feature.

### When Mango Display Might Be Right

Choose Mango Display if:
- ✅ You specifically want a dedicated wall touchscreen
- ✅ You're home most of the time (don't need mobile coordination)
- ✅ Your family is single-household, traditional structure
- ✅ You have $500+ budget for a calendar display
- ✅ You don't need AI, voice control, or advanced planning
- ✅ Visual presence in the kitchen is your #1 priority
- ✅ You've tried app-based solutions and didn't use them

### The Honest Trade-Off

**Mango Display gives you:** Premium wall hardware, visual presence, touchscreen interaction

**Mango Display costs you:** AI planning, voice control, mobile access, multi-family support, $500+, and flexibility

For most families, that trade-off doesn't work. But for a specific subset who prioritize the wall display experience above all else, Mango Display delivers what they want.

## Real-World Scenarios: Which Solution Wins?

### Scenario 1: Dual-Income Working Parents (Most Common)

**Sarah & Marcus both work full-time. Two kids (8 and 11). Constantly coordinating soccer, piano, work travel, and household tasks.**

**With Mango Display:**
- Beautiful display in kitchen, but they're at work all day
- Can't add items from office, car, or grocery store  
- Both leave for work at 7am, return at 6pm—display sits unused 11 hours daily
- Marcus thinks of something at work → texts Sarah → she adds it when home → delay and friction
- No AI help managing the complexity
- **Rating: 4/10** — Looks nice but doesn't solve their actual problems

**With Honeydew:**
- Sarah voice-adds grocery items during commute
- Marcus checks kids' schedule from work conference room
- AI helps find optimal time for family dentist appointments
- Both coordinate in real-time from anywhere
- Weekend planning happens via AI: "Plan our Saturday with soccer at 10, grocery shopping, and family movie night"
- **Rating: 9/10** — Actually solves their coordination problems

**Winner: Honeydew** — Working parents need coordination everywhere, not just in their kitchen.

---

### Scenario 2: Stay-at-Home Parent with Young Kids

**Jessica stays home with three kids under 6. Hands are literally always full. Needs visibility and quick capture.**

**With Mango Display:**
- Display in kitchen is genuinely useful—she passes it constantly
- BUT: Can't interact when holding baby
- Can't add items from playroom, backyard, car
- No voice control means waiting until hands are free
- Managing three kids' activities manually is overwhelming
- **Rating: 6/10** — Visual presence helps, but lack of voice is painful

**With Honeydew:**
- "Hey Honeydew, add diapers to shopping list" while changing diaper
- "Schedule Emma's doctor appointment for Thursday at 2" while making lunch
- AI generates weekly activity schedule based on kids' ages
- Photograph school calendar → events added automatically
- **DIY option:** Mount old iPad in kitchen, run Honeydew, get wall display + AI
- **Rating: 9/10** — Voice control is essential when hands are always occupied

**Winner: Honeydew** — Voice control isn't a luxury when you're managing toddlers.

---

### Scenario 3: Divorced Co-Parents

**Rachel and David share 50/50 custody of two kids. Need to coordinate across households without conflict.**

**With Mango Display:**
- Would need two displays: $1,000 total
- Displays can't coordinate with each other
- Each household has different "source of truth"
- Kids' activities get double-entered or missed entirely
- No documentation trail for co-parenting communication
- **Rating: 2/10** — Architecture fundamentally doesn't support their needs

**With Honeydew:**
- "Kids - Rachel & David" group: Both parents coordinate custody, school, activities
- "Rachel's Household" group: Just her home tasks
- "David's Household" group: Just his home tasks
- Kids have their own logins, see their schedule across both homes
- All coordination documented in-app (useful if disputes arise)
- Changes sync instantly—no duplicate entry, no conflicts
- **Cost: $79/year for everyone**
- **Rating: 10/10** — Purpose-built for exactly this situation

**Winner: Honeydew** — Mango Display cannot serve co-parenting families at any price.

---

### Scenario 4: Extended Family Coordination

**The Johnsons coordinate between their household, grandparents who help with pickup, and siblings who share a beach house.**

**With Mango Display:**
- One display for one household
- Grandparents can't see the schedule (no account/access)
- Beach house coordination requires separate system entirely
- **Rating: 3/10** — Single-family architecture fails complex families

**With Honeydew:**
- "Johnson Household" group: Daily family tasks
- "Grandparents Helpers" group: Pickup schedules, activities they help with
- "Beach House" group: Siblings coordinate shared property usage
- Everyone sees exactly what they need, nothing they don't
- One app manages all three coordination needs
- **Rating: 9/10** — Multi-family architecture handles complexity elegantly

**Winner: Honeydew** — Modern families aren't single-unit structures.

---

### Scenario 5: Tech-Averse Family Member

**Tom loves technology. His wife Linda prefers "simple." Need a solution that works for both.**

**With Mango Display:**
- Linda might appreciate the simple, physical interface
- But she'd also need to learn the touch navigation
- Tom gets frustrated by lack of AI and mobile access
- Display serves Linda's preference at Tom's expense
- **Rating: 5/10** — Serves one person's preference

**With Honeydew:**
- Tom uses AI, voice, advanced features
- Linda can use simple tap interface on her phone
- Or: Linda walks by kitchen tablet showing Honeydew calendar (same visual presence)
- Both get the experience level they prefer
- **Rating: 8/10** — Flexibility serves both users

**Winner: Honeydew** — Scales to different comfort levels within same family.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is Mango Display really worth $500?

**A:** For most families, no. You're paying $500+ for a touchscreen calendar that lacks AI, voice control, mobile access, and multi-family support. The only genuine benefit over Honeydew is dedicated wall presence—and you can get that with a $80 tablet running Honeydew.

### Q: Can I use both Mango Display and Honeydew?

**A:** Yes. Both sync with Google/Apple Calendar. You could use Mango Display for kitchen visibility while using Honeydew for AI planning and mobile coordination. However, most families find this redundant within a few weeks.

### Q: Does Honeydew have a wall display option?

**A:** Not hardware we sell, but any tablet can run Honeydew's web app. Mount it in your kitchen for the same visual presence as Mango Display, plus full AI features.

### Q: Is Mango Display better than Skylight?

**A:** They're similar products with similar limitations. Both are wall-mounted displays without AI or voice control. Mango Display is newer and may offer some interface improvements, but the fundamental limitations (no AI, no portability, no multi-family) remain.

### Q: What happens if my Mango Display breaks?

**A:** You're out $500 for a replacement. With Honeydew, if your phone breaks, your account and data are safe in the cloud—just log in on any device.

### Q: Can divorced parents use Mango Display effectively?

**A:** Not really. You'd need two displays ($1,000) that still can't coordinate with each other. Honeydew's multi-family architecture is specifically designed for co-parenting.

### Q: Is voice control actually useful for family calendars?

**A:** Essential. Parents are constantly multi-tasking—cooking, driving, holding kids, working. Voice input lets you capture items the moment you think of them, not when you finally have free hands.

### Q: Does Honeydew work offline?

**A:** Core features work offline with sync when reconnected. Mango Display also requires WiFi for calendar sync.

### Q: What's the learning curve for each?

**A:** Mango Display: Learn touch interface, ~30 minutes. Honeydew: Download app and start using, <5 minutes to basic functionality. AI features reveal themselves as you use them naturally.

### Q: Is my data private and secure?

**A:** Honeydew uses bank-level encryption, never sells data, and is GDPR/CCPA compliant. Check Mango Display's specific privacy policy, as hardware devices can have different data practices.

## The Bottom Line: Software Beats Hardware

**Mango Display represents a bet on dedicated hardware:** Beautiful touchscreens, physical presence, visual simplicity. For a narrow use case (wealthy family, mostly home, traditional structure, no AI needs), it works.

**But in 2026, most families need more.** They need:
- AI to handle planning complexity
- Voice control for hands-free capture
- Mobile access for coordination anywhere
- Multi-family architecture for modern family structures
- Integration that actually syncs both directions

**Honeydew delivers all of this** at ~$500 less than Mango Display's first year cost.

### Choose Mango Display if:
- ✅ Dedicated wall touchscreen is your #1 priority
- ✅ You have $500+ budget for a calendar
- ✅ You're home most of the time
- ✅ Single, traditional household structure
- ✅ You don't need AI or voice features
- ✅ Aesthetic design matters more than functionality

### Choose Honeydew if:
- ✅ You want AI that actually plans and coordinates
- ✅ You need voice control for hands-free operation
- ✅ You coordinate from work, car, store, anywhere
- ✅ You have multi-family complexity (divorced, extended family)
- ✅ You want more features for less money
- ✅ You prefer software that improves over time

**For 80%+ of families, Honeydew is the better choice.** You get more functionality, more flexibility, and more value—without spending $500 on hardware that will eventually become obsolete.
