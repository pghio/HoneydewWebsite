    <p>
      This Policy applies to information collected through the Honeydew application and related websites located at

      <li><strong>Usage Information</strong>: In-app interactions, device information, and diagnostic logs to maintain reliability and security.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Calendar Data (optional)</strong>: If you connect Google Calendar, we access read-only calendar data
        necessary to display events in Honeydew and associate items. This includes event metadata (IDs, etags, titles,
        start/end times, location, attendees if present) and sync tokens.</li>

      <li>Communicate with you about updates, security notices, and support responses.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use)</h2>
    <p>
      Honeydew’s use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>,

      <li>We use Google Calendar data solely to provide user-facing features within Honeydew (displaying events and associations).</li>
      <li>We do not sell Google user data and do not use it for advertising.</li>
      <li>Access tokens are stored securely and used only to provide the requested functionality.</li>
      <li>You can disconnect Google Calendar at any time in Settings, which revokes tokens and stops synchronization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>

      deleted when you disconnect Google or delete your account, subject to reasonable backup retention.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use industry-standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information.
