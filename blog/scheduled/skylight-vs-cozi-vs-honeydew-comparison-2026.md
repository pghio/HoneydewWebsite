## FAQ

### Is Skylight better than Cozi?
They solve different problems. Skylight is a wall display; Cozi is a mobile app. Skylight costs $536+ over 3 years; Cozi is free or $30/year. Choose Skylight for hardware presence; choose Cozi for budget simplicity.

### Is Honeydew better than Skylight?
For most families, yes. Honeydew provides AI planning, voice capture, and multi-family support without requiring $300 hardware. You can mount a $100 tablet for the same "wall calendar" effect with more features.

### Can I use Honeydew with Skylight?
Partially. You could sync Honeydew's calendar to Google, then display Google Calendar on Skylight. But you'd lose Honeydew's lists and AI features on the display.

### Does Cozi have AI?
No. Cozi is a manual-entry organizer. It doesn't offer AI planning, voice input, or photo recognition.

### Which is best for co-parenting?
Honeydew, by far. It's the only one with true multi-household support where each parent can have private calendars while sharing kid-related events.

## Bottom Line

| Your Priority | Best Choice | Why |
|---------------|-------------|-----|
| Wall display aesthetics | Skylight | Purpose-built hardware |
| Lowest cost | Cozi Free | $0 forever |
| AI automation | Honeydew | Only option with AI |
| Multi-family coordination | Honeydew | True multi-household support |
| Simplicity over features | Cozi | Familiar, no learning curve |
| Best value overall | Honeydew | Most features per dollar |

**Our recommendation:** There's no universal "best." Skylight owners genuinely love the dedicated display. Cozi families appreciate the simplicity. If you want to try AI planning, Honeydew's free tier lets you test without commitment—but it's a different workflow than either Skylight or Cozi.
