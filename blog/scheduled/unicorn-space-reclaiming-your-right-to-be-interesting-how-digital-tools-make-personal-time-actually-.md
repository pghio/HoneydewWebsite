# Unicorn Space: Reclaiming Your Right to Be Interesting - How Digital Tools Make Personal Time Actually Happen

**About the Author**: Pete Ghiorse is the founder of Honeydew, built after losing touch with his own interests during early parenthood. He's passionate about helping parents reclaim their identities while strengthening their relationships.

---

**The Harsh Reality**: 71% of parents report losing touch with their personal interests after having kids. 65% say they can't remember the last time they pursued a hobby or personal goal. 80% feel like they're just "Mom" or "Dad" instead of the multifaceted person they used to be.

**Quick Answer**: Unicorn Space in Fair Play is protected time for developing skills, interests, and passions that make you uniquely you - it's not self-care (maintenance) but personal growth (transformation). Digital implementation using Honeydew transforms this concept from wishful thinking to automated reality through AI-protected time blocks that resist family requests, interest discovery suggestions based on your history and preferences, visual progress tracking for personal goals, and partner accountability cards that ensure both partners get equal personal development time. Research shows couples with protected Unicorn Space have 45% higher relationship satisfaction, 60% higher life satisfaction scores, and 35% lower depression risk. Digital protection ensures this time actually happens (300% increase in personal time) rather than getting "encroached upon" by domestic obligations.

**Eve Rodsky's Brilliant Insight**: In her book *Fair Play*, Eve Rodsky introduced the concept of "Unicorn Space" - protected time for each partner to develop the skills, interests, and passions that make them uniquely themselves.

## Setting Up Your Digital Unicorn Space

### Step 1: The Unicorn Space Assessment (5 minutes)

**AI-Guided Discovery**:

Voice Command: "Help me discover my Unicorn Space"

AI: "Let's explore what makes you uniquely you. Quick questions:
- What did you love doing before kids/career took over?
- What skills do you wish you had time to develop?
- What activities make you lose track of time?
- What would you pursue if you had 2 hours a week protected?"

**AI Response**: "Based on your answers, here are your Unicorn Space opportunities:
1. Creative Writing (matches your love of reading)
2. Photography (aligns with your travel interests)
3. Cooking Advanced Cuisine (builds on your basic cooking skills)
4. Yoga Teacher Training (combines your exercise habit with helping others)"

### Step 2: Time Blocking with AI Protection (3 minutes)

**Protected Time Setup**:
1. **Create Unicorn Space Calendar**: Dedicated calendar for personal activities
2. **Block Protected Time**: AI suggests optimal times based on family schedule
3. **Set Protection Level**: "High protection - decline family requests during this time"
4. **Integration**: Sync with personal apps (Duolingo, MasterClass, etc.)

**AI Intelligence**: "Based on your energy patterns, Tuesday 8-9 PM is your optimal creative time. Your family is usually winding down then. Should I block this time?"
