## Why Look for a Skylight Calendar Alternative?

Skylight Calendar has become a popular family organization tool, but it's not perfect for everyone:

- **Hardware cost**: $300+ upfront for the display
- **Subscription fees**: $79/year for premium features
- **Limited AI**: No voice commands or smart planning
- **Single purpose**: Just a calendar, not a complete organizer
- **Setup complexity**: Mounting, power, WiFi configuration

Many families want the *idea* of Skylight—a centralized family hub—without the cost and limitations.

- **Natural language planning**: Just say "plan our camping trip" and the AI creates packing lists, adds calendar events, and shares with family
- **Voice and photo input**: Speak a quick command or photograph a handwritten list
- **Two-way calendar sync**: Updates flow both ways with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar
- **Multiple family groups**: Join your household, your parents' family, friend groups—all in one app
- **Real-time collaboration**: Everyone sees changes instantly

### Honeydew vs. Skylight Calendar

|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Setup** | Wall mount, power, WiFi | Download app, sign in (2 min) |
| **Cost** | $300 upfront + $79/yr | Free or $7.99/mo for premium |
| **Planning** | Manual entry | AI generates lists and schedules |
| **Voice** | No | Yes—speak requests hands-free |
| **Photos** | Limited | Yes—photograph lists, receipts |
| **Devices** | One display | All your phones, tablets, computers |
| **Traveling** | Stays on wall | Comes with you |

### Who Should Choose Honeydew

- Families who want AI to do the planning work
- Anyone who doesn't want to mount hardware

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Skylight Calendar worth the money?

Skylight Calendar works well for what it does—a dedicated family calendar display. But at $300+ upfront plus $79/year subscription, it's expensive compared to software-only alternatives like Honeydew (free or $7.99/month) or Cozi ($30/year) that offer more features.

### What's the cheapest Skylight alternative?

Google Family Calendar is completely free. Cozi is the cheapest dedicated family organizer at free or $30/year. Honeydew offers a free tier with more AI features than Skylight.

### Can I use my iPad as a family calendar like Skylight?
