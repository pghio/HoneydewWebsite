## FAQ

### Is TimeTree good for families?
Yes, for calendar sharing specifically. It's clean, simple, and reliable. But it has no lists, no AI, and limited multi-family support.

### Does TimeTree have AI?
No. TimeTree is a manual-entry calendar with no AI planning, voice input, or smart suggestions.

### Can I import TimeTree to Honeydew?
Yes. Export TimeTree calendar as .ics file, import to Google/Apple Calendar, then Honeydew syncs with Google/Apple.

### Which has better calendar sync?
Both sync two-way with Google and Apple calendars. It's a tie.

### Is Honeydew worth the extra cost?
If you value AI automation (packing lists in seconds, voice capture, planning assistance), yes. If you only need calendar viewing, TimeTree at $30/year may be enough.

## Bottom Line

| Your Priority | Best Choice |
|---------------|-------------|
| Simplest shared calendar | **TimeTree** |
| AI + lists + automation | **Honeydew** |
| Lowest cost | **TimeTree** |
| Multi-family coordination | **Honeydew** |
| "Just show me the schedule" | **TimeTree** |
| "Help me manage family chaos" | **Honeydew** |

**The honest take:** TimeTree is excellent at one thing: shared calendars. It's polished, fast, and does exactly what it promises. Honeydew tries to do more—which means more features but also more complexity. If your family just needs to see each other's schedules, TimeTree is probably the better choice. Honeydew makes sense when you're drowning in coordination work beyond just calendaring.
