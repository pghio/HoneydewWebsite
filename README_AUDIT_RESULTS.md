## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES YOU NEED TO FIX

### Priority 1: Missing Images (Biggest Impact)
**Problem:** 4 image files don't exist, breaking social sharing

**Missing:**
- `/public/og-image-ai.jpg` (Facebook/LinkedIn preview)
- `/public/twitter-card-ai.jpg` (Twitter preview)
- `/public/logo.png` (Search engine knowledge panels)
- `/public/favicon.ico` (Browser tab icon)

**Why Critical:** When people share your site, they see broken images = unprofessional

**Fix:** See **IMAGE_ASSET_SPECIFICATIONS.md** for exact requirements

**Time:** 2-3 hours (or $20-40 to hire designer)

**Expected Impact:**
- +30-50% social share click-through rate
- Professional appearance
- Better brand recognition

---

### Priority 2: Google Analytics Placeholder
**Problem:** GA4 ID is `G-XXXXXXXXXX` (not real)

**Location:** `index.html` lines 17 and 22

**Fix:**
1. Go to https://analytics.google.com/
2. Create GA4 property for honeydew.app
3. Replace BOTH instances of `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your real Measurement ID

**Time:** 5 minutes

**Impact:** Start collecting visitor data today

---

### Priority 3: Blog Posts Not Integrated
**Problem:** 3 markdown files in `/blog/` folder aren't connected to website

**Files:**
- `best-ai-calendar-apps-for-families-2025.md`
- `best-voice-controlled-family-organization-apps-2025.md`
- `best-apps-for-coordinating-multi-family-groups-2025.md`

**Options:**
1. Integrate them (recommended) - 3 additional SEO articles
2. Delete them - Focus on hardcoded case studies

**See:** Section #3 in WEBSITE_AUDIT_REPORT.md

---

## 📊 OTHER ISSUES FOUND

### Medium Priority:
- Newsletter signup form (no backend integration)
- Broken footer links (#pricing, #about, #blog don't exist)
- Placeholder pages (/help, /docs, /api, /community are generic)

### SEO Opportunities:
- Missing canonical URLs (prevents duplicate content)
- Blog posts need individual meta tags
- No Article structured data
- Limited internal linking strategy
