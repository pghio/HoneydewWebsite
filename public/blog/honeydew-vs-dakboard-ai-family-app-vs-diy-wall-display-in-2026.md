# Honeydew vs DAKboard: Which Family Calendar Solution is Better in 2026?

## Quick Answer

**DAKboard or Honeydew?** **Honeydew is the better choice for most families** who want a family organization system that actually helps coordinate, plan, and reduce mental load—not just display information. While DAKboard creates beautiful wall displays, it requires technical setup, can't accept input, has no AI, and won't help you while you're away from home.

Honeydew delivers what modern families actually need: a **27-tool AI agent** that plans trips, generates checklists, and handles complex requests. **Voice control with 96.3% accuracy** lets you add items hands-free while cooking or driving. **Two-way calendar sync** keeps everyone updated in real-time. And it works on **every device you already own**—no Raspberry Pi, no TV mounting, no technical setup required.

**Bottom line:** DAKboard is a passive display. Honeydew is an active assistant. Choose DAKboard if you want a beautiful DIY project for your kitchen wall. Choose Honeydew if you want AI to actually help manage your family's chaos.

## Feature Comparison: DAKboard vs Honeydew

### AI & Automation: Which Solution is Smarter?

**The fundamental difference:** DAKboard is a display. Honeydew is an assistant.

**DAKboard's Intelligence:**
- No AI capabilities whatsoever
- No automation or smart features
- No natural language processing
- Displays information you've created elsewhere
- 100% passive—shows what exists, doesn't help create

**Honeydew's AI:**
Honeydew's AI agent includes 27+ specialized tools trained specifically for family coordination:
- **Smart Scheduling:** Analyzes family calendars to find optimal meeting times
- **Conflict Detection:** Identifies double-bookings and schedule conflicts automatically
- **Natural Language Processing:** Understands requests like "schedule soccer practice every Tuesday at 4pm"
- **Trip Planning:** Creates comprehensive vacation plans with activities, packing lists, and reservations
- **Task Decomposition:** Breaks complex requests into actionable steps
- **Checklist Generation:** AI-powered lists that include items you might forget
- **Learning System:** 80% cache hit rate means faster, more personalized responses over time

**Example Comparison:**

> **Task:** "Plan our camping trip next month"
>
> **With DAKboard:**
> - Manually create calendar event in Google Calendar
> - Manually research camping gear needed
> - Manually create packing list in separate app
> - Manually add shopping items in another app
> - Manually text family members
> - **Time: 45-60 minutes**
>
> **With Honeydew:**
> - Say: "Plan camping trip for July 15th weekend with packing list"
> - AI creates calendar event, comprehensive packing checklist, shopping list for supplies, activity suggestions, and notifies all family members
> - **Time: 30 seconds**

**Winner: Honeydew** — DAKboard doesn't even attempt to compete in this category. It's like comparing a TV to a personal assistant.

---

### Voice Control: Hands-Free Family Management

Modern parents need hands-free input. You're stirring dinner, holding a baby, or driving when you suddenly remember something important.

**DAKboard's Voice:**
- ❌ Zero voice recognition
- ❌ No voice input capability
- ❌ Cannot add events, tasks, or items by voice
- ❌ Must use separate device/app to add content
- ❌ Display-only—no input method at all

**Honeydew's Voice:**
Honeydew uses OpenAI's Whisper AI for industry-leading voice recognition:
- **96.3% Accuracy:** 10-28 percentage points higher than competitors
- **58 Language Support:** Works for multilingual families
- **Noise Tolerance:** Accurate even in busy household environments
- **No Hardware Required:** Works directly on your phone
- **Natural Language:** Speak however you want, AI understands context

**Example voice commands:**
- "Add milk, bread, and eggs to the grocery list" (while cooking)
- "Schedule dentist appointments for both kids next Wednesday" (while driving)
- "Create packing list for beach trip" (hands full with luggage)
- "What's on the calendar tomorrow?" (getting ready for bed)

**The core problem with DAKboard:** It's a display. You can't talk to your TV. If you want to add something while looking at your DAKboard, you need to pull out your phone, open Google Calendar, navigate to the right date, and manually type the event. By then, you've probably forgotten what you wanted to add.

**Winner: Honeydew** — DAKboard has literally no voice capabilities.

---

### Calendar Sync: Keeping Everyone Updated

**DAKboard's Calendar:**
- ✅ Imports from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, Office 365
- ⚠️ **One-way sync only**—displays calendars, doesn't write back
- ⚠️ No native calendar creation (must use source apps)
- ⚠️ Refresh intervals vary (not real-time)
- ❌ Cannot add events from the display
- ❌ No conflict detection
- ❌ No smart scheduling

**Honeydew's Calendar:**
- ✅ **Two-Way Sync:** Changes flow both directions (Honeydew ↔ Google/Apple)
- ✅ Full bidirectional integration with Google and Apple Calendar
- ✅ 15-minute sync intervals (near real-time)
- ✅ Create events directly via voice, text, or AI
- ✅ AI-powered conflict detection
- ✅ Smart scheduling finds optimal times
- ✅ Attach lists and tasks to calendar events

**The key difference:** DAKboard shows your calendar. Honeydew manages your calendar. With DAKboard, you still need Google Calendar or Apple Calendar to actually create and modify events. With Honeydew, you can do everything in one place—and the AI helps.

**Winner: Honeydew** — Two-way sync with AI assistance beats passive display.

---

### Multi-Family Support: Modern Families are Complex

40%+ of families today coordinate across multiple households. Divorced parents, blended families, grandparents helping with childcare, friend groups sharing carpools.

**DAKboard's Multi-Family:**
- ❌ Single display model—one screen shows one set of calendars
- ❌ Cannot manage multiple household contexts
- ❌ No concept of "family groups"
- ❌ Would need multiple displays and configurations for different family contexts
- ❌ No coordination between co-parents in different homes

**Honeydew's Multi-Family:**
- ✅ **Unlimited Groups:** Join as many family groups as you need
- ✅ **Instant Switching:** <1 second to switch between groups
- ✅ **Privacy Controls:** Each group is completely separate unless you choose to share
- ✅ **Role-Based Access:** Admin, member, and view-only permissions
- ✅ **Cross-Group Coordination:** See conflicts across all your family groups

**Real-world example:**
- "Kids - Mom & Dad" group (both divorced parents coordinate custody and activities)
- "Mom's Household" group (just your home's private stuff)
- "Dad's Household" group (his home's schedules)
- "Extended Family" group (grandparents, aunts, uncles for holidays)
- "Soccer Team Parents" group (carpools and snack schedules)

All managed in one app with instant switching. With DAKboard, you'd need separate displays or complex calendar filtering for each context.

**Winner: Honeydew** — DAKboard's architecture doesn't support modern family complexity.

---

### Lists & Task Management: Beyond the Calendar

Family organization isn't just calendars—it's grocery lists, packing lists, chore charts, to-do lists, and project tracking.

**DAKboard's Lists:**
- ⚠️ Displays to-do lists from external services (Todoist, Google Tasks, Trello)
- ❌ Cannot create or modify lists from the display
- ❌ No native list management
- ❌ No collaborative editing
- ❌ No AI-generated lists
- ❌ Cannot attach lists to calendar events

**Honeydew's Lists:**
- ✅ **Native List Management:** Grocery, packing, to-do, gift, project lists
- ✅ **AI-Generated Lists:** "Create packing list for ski trip" → comprehensive checklist
- ✅ **Collaborative Editing:** Multiple family members add simultaneously
- ✅ **Voice Input:** Add items hands-free
- ✅ **Photo Recognition:** Photograph a recipe → AI extracts ingredients to grocery list
- ✅ **Event Attachment:** Link lists to calendar events (packing list attached to vacation)
- ✅ **Smart Suggestions:** AI knows what you typically pack for beach trips

**Winner: Honeydew** — Native list creation and AI generation beats passive display.

### Hardware Requirements: DIY vs Download-and-Go

**DAKboard's Setup:**
1. **Option A - DIY Route:**
   - Purchase a TV or monitor ($100-500)
   - Purchase Raspberry Pi and SD card ($50-100)
   - Download and flash DAKboard OS
   - Configure WiFi and display settings
   - Mount TV on wall (hardware, electrical considerations)
   - Configure DAKboard software and calendars
   - **Technical skill required:** Moderate to High
   - **Setup time:** 2-6 hours

2. **Option B - Pre-Built:**
   - Purchase DAKboard display ($249-$399)
   - Mount on wall
   - Configure WiFi and calendars
   - **Setup time:** 30-60 minutes

**Honeydew's Setup:**
1. Download app on iPhone or Android (free)
2. Create account (email or Google/Apple sign-in)
3. Connect calendar (optional, 2 clicks)
4. Invite family members (share link)
- **Technical skill required:** None
- **Setup time:** 5 minutes

**Wall Display Requirement:**
- **DAKboard:** Requires dedicated display hardware
- **Honeydew:** Works on devices you already own. Optionally mount old tablet on wall for similar effect

**Winner: Honeydew** — Zero hardware purchase, works immediately.

---

### Mobile Access: Coordination On-the-Go

Life happens away from your kitchen wall. You remember the dentist appointment while at work. You need the grocery list at the store. You want to check tomorrow's schedule before bed.

**DAKboard's Mobile:**
- ❌ No mobile app for viewing or editing
- ❌ Display is fixed to your wall—useless when away
- ⚠️ Must use source apps (Google Calendar, Todoist) when mobile
- ❌ No unified family view on mobile
- ❌ Cannot add content to DAKboard while away

**Honeydew's Mobile:**
- ✅ Full-featured iOS app
- ✅ Full-featured Android app
- ✅ Web browser access (any device)
- ✅ Same functionality everywhere
- ✅ Voice input works on mobile
- ✅ Add items from anywhere instantly
- ✅ Get notifications when family adds/changes things

**The fundamental problem:** DAKboard is at home. Your life isn't.

You're at the grocery store and realize you need something. With DAKboard, you open Google Keep or Todoist, add it, and hope it syncs to the display. With Honeydew, you say "add avocados to grocery list" and it's done—visible to your whole family instantly.

**Winner: Honeydew** — Works everywhere, not just your kitchen.

---

### Customization & Visual Appeal: Form vs Function

This is where DAKboard genuinely shines.

**DAKboard's Customization:**
- ✅ **Multiple Themes:** Light, dark, minimal, photo-focused
- ✅ **Widget-Based Layout:** Arrange calendar, weather, photos, lists exactly how you want
- ✅ **Custom CSS:** Power users can modify appearance completely
- ✅ **Screen Scheduling:** Different layouts for morning vs evening
- ✅ **Photo Integration:** Beautiful slideshows from Google Photos, Instagram, Dropbox
- ✅ **Information Widgets:** Weather, news, sports scores, stock prices, custom RSS

**Honeydew's Interface:**
- ✅ Clean, modern design optimized for usability
- ✅ Color coding by family member
- ⚠️ Standard app interface—not highly customizable
- ⚠️ No widget-based layout customization
- ❌ No photo slideshow feature
- ❌ No news/weather widgets

**Why this matters (and doesn't):**
DAKboard is designed to be something beautiful you look at. Honeydew is designed to be something useful you interact with. Different goals, different designs.

If your priority is a stunning wall display that impresses guests and shows beautiful family photos between calendar views, DAKboard delivers.

If your priority is actually coordinating your family with less effort, Honeydew delivers.

**Winner: DAKboard** for visual customization. Honeydew optimizes for utility over aesthetics.

## Real-World Scenarios: Who Should Use Which?

### Scenario 1: Working Parents with Busy Schedules (The Hendersons)

**The Challenge:** Both parents work full-time. Two kids with different activity schedules. Coordination happens via text threads that get lost. Constantly forgetting things.

**With DAKboard:**
- Beautiful display in kitchen shows everyone's schedules
- Kids can glance at what's happening today
- **But:**
  - Parents can't add things while at work
  - Can't check schedule from office
  - No AI help planning complex activities
  - Still using 3-4 other apps for lists, tasks, etc.
  - When kid brings home permission slip, still manually entering everything
- **Time saved:** ~1.5 hours/week (better visibility when home)

**With Honeydew:**
- Voice add items during commute
- Photograph school forms → AI extracts dates and requirements
- AI plans birthday parties, vacations, activity schedules
- Coordinate from anywhere (work, grocery store, car)
- Get notified instantly when spouse adds something
- One app replaces calendar + lists + notes + task manager
- **Time saved:** 4-5 hours/week

**Verdict:** Honeydew saves **3x more time** for working parents who need on-the-go coordination.

---

### Scenario 2: Tech-Enthusiast Parent (Marcus)

**The Challenge:** Loves DIY projects. Has spare Raspberry Pi and old monitor. Enjoys tinkering with home automation. Wants something customized exactly to his preferences.

**With DAKboard:**
- Fun weekend project setting up display
- Complete control over layout and appearance
- Integrates with his other home automation systems
- Can show weather, news, smart home status alongside calendar
- Enjoys maintaining and updating the system
- **Satisfaction:** High (it's a project, not just a product)

**With Honeydew:**
- Download and done in 5 minutes
- No DIY satisfaction
- Can't customize interface extensively
- Feels "off-the-shelf"
- **But:**
  - AI features genuinely useful
  - Family prefers the mobile app
  - Voice control popular with kids

**Verdict:** DAKboard wins for tech enthusiasts who enjoy the build process. But Marcus might end up using Honeydew anyway for the AI features, while keeping DAKboard as a passive display.

---

### Scenario 3: Divorced Co-Parents (Jennifer & David)

**The Challenge:** Kids alternate between two households on a 2-2-3 schedule. Need to coordinate activities, school events, medical appointments. Communication is sometimes strained—want neutral documentation.

**With DAKboard:**
- Would need **two separate displays** (one per household)
- Each display shows different Google Calendar views
- No unified "kids schedule" that both parents see identically
- Can't coordinate across households natively
- **Total cost:** $200-800 for two displays + $120-192/year software
- **Doesn't solve:** Real-time coordination, communication documentation, shared lists

**With Honeydew:**
- Both parents join shared "Kids - Mom & Dad" group
- Each maintains private household group
- Kids see unified schedule on their own phones
- All changes documented with timestamps (useful for custody disputes)
- No hardware purchase needed
- **Total cost:** $0-$158/year for both parents
- **Time saved:** 5+ hours/week (eliminates constant texting)

**Verdict:** Honeydew is **purpose-built for this scenario**. DAKboard's architecture fundamentally doesn't support it.

---

### Scenario 4: The Retired Couple (Tom & Linda)

**The Challenge:** Simple schedule—doctor appointments, social activities, grandkid visits. Want something visible in kitchen. Not very tech-savvy. Have budget but don't want complexity.

**With DAKboard Pre-Built:**
- Purchase $349 display, plug in, configure
- Shows calendar and weather
- Nice photo slideshow of grandkids
- Visible daily reminder of schedules
- **But:**
  - Still need to add events on phone/computer
  - No voice control (harder as eyesight/dexterity declines)
  - Limited functionality

**With Honeydew:**
- More features than they need
- Phone-based (they prefer physical display)
- **But:**
  - Voice control helpful for hands-free adding
  - Coordinate with adult kids/grandkids easily
  - Useful when traveling (they travel often)

**Verdict:** Slight edge to **DAKboard** for simplicity and visual presence, but Honeydew's voice control may become more valuable as they age.

| Premium+ Software | $96/year |
| **First Year (24" display)** | **$445** |
| **5-Year Total** | **$829** |

### Honeydew Total Cost Analysis

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | 5-Year |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Free Tier | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Premium Monthly | $7.99 | $95.88 | $479.40 |
| Premium Annual | - | $79 | $395 |

**Hardware cost:** $0 (works on existing devices)

### Side-by-Side Cost Comparison

| Timeframe | Honeydew Free | Honeydew Premium | DAKboard DIY | DAKboard Pre-Built |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **First Year** | $0 | $79-$96 | $190-366 | $345-495 |
| **3 Years** | $0 | $237-$288 | $310-558 | $537-687 |
| **5 Years** | $0 | $395-$480 | $430-846 | $729-879 |

### Hidden Costs to Consider

**DAKboard Hidden Costs:**
- Electricity to run display 24/7 (~$20-50/year)
- Replacement Raspberry Pi if it fails (~$60-80)
- TV/monitor replacement if screen burns in or dies
- Time investment for setup and maintenance (your time has value)
- Still need other apps for lists, tasks, meal planning

**Honeydew Hidden Costs:**
- None—works on devices you already charge and maintain

### Value Calculation

**The real question:** What's your time worth?

If Honeydew saves you 3 extra hours per week compared to DAKboard (due to AI planning, voice control, and mobile access), that's 156 hours per year.

At even a modest $20/hour value of time:
- **156 hours × $20 = $3,120/year in time value**

Against Honeydew's $79/year cost, that's a **39x return on investment**.

DAKboard, while useful for visibility, doesn't generate the same time savings because it's passive—you still do all the work; it just shows the result.

## Migration Guide: Switching from DAKboard to Honeydew

Already have DAKboard set up? Here's how to transition to Honeydew while keeping your wall display.

### What Transfers Automatically

- **Calendar Events:** If you use Google or Apple Calendar, Honeydew syncs automatically. Your existing events appear immediately.
- **Family Member Colors:** Recreate color coding in Honeydew (takes 2 minutes)
- **Recurring Events:** Already in your calendar, auto-syncs

### What Requires Manual Recreation

- **Any local DAKboard settings** (custom layouts, themes—these stay on DAKboard)
- **Photo slideshows** (Honeydew doesn't have this feature—keep DAKboard for photos!)
- **Custom widgets** (weather, news—not in Honeydew)

### The Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

You don't have to choose! Many families run both:

1. **Keep DAKboard** as a passive display for:
   - Beautiful wall presence
   - Photo slideshows
   - Weather at a glance
   - "Command center" aesthetic

2. **Use Honeydew** for:
   - Actually adding and managing calendar events
   - Voice input
   - AI planning and lists
   - Mobile coordination
   - Multi-family management

Your DAKboard will show all the events you create in Honeydew (via Google Calendar sync). You get the beautiful display AND the AI assistant.

### Migration Timeline

**Day 1: Parallel Setup**
- Download Honeydew (5 minutes)
- Connect Google/Apple Calendar (same calendar DAKboard uses)
- Invite family members

**Week 1: Test Drive**
- Use Honeydew for all new events and lists
- Notice DAKboard displaying Honeydew-created events
- Try voice input while cooking
- Test AI features ("plan weekend activities")

**Week 2: Primary Switch**
- Make Honeydew your primary family coordination tool
- DAKboard becomes pure display (shows what you create in Honeydew)
- Family uses Honeydew mobile apps for coordination

**Week 3+: Optimize**
- Either keep DAKboard as display + use Honeydew for coordination
- Or unplug DAKboard if you find you don't miss the wall display
- Many families keep both—DAKboard for aesthetics, Honeydew for function

---

## DAKboard Strengths: Where It Genuinely Excels

Let's be fair—DAKboard does some things really well.

### 1. Unmatched Customization

If you want complete control over your display's appearance, DAKboard wins hands-down. Choose themes, arrange widgets, use custom CSS, create exactly the aesthetic you want. Honeydew's interface is clean but standardized.

### 2. DIY Satisfaction

There's genuine joy in building something yourself. Setting up a Raspberry Pi, configuring displays, mounting the perfect TV—it's a project, not just a product. Tech enthusiasts appreciate this.

### 3. One-Time Hardware Investment

Once you buy the hardware, it's yours. No subscription required for basic features (though Premium unlocks best features for $60-96/year). There's something appealing about "owning" versus "renting."

### 4. Information Hub Beyond Calendar

DAKboard shows weather, news, sports, stocks, RSS feeds, smart home status, and more. It's a true information display, not just a family calendar. Honeydew focuses specifically on family coordination.

### 5. Stunning Photo Integration

DAKboard's photo slideshows from Google Photos, Instagram, and Dropbox are beautiful. Families love seeing photos rotate throughout the day. Honeydew doesn't have this feature.

### When DAKboard Might Be the Better Choice

- ✅ You want a beautiful wall display more than smart coordination
- ✅ You enjoy DIY projects and tinkering
- ✅ You're home most of the time (don't need mobile coordination)
- ✅ You have spare hardware (old TV, Raspberry Pi)
- ✅ You want weather, news, photos alongside your calendar
- ✅ You prefer one-time purchases over subscriptions
- ✅ Your family is tech-comfortable with multiple apps
- ✅ You have a single-family household (no co-parenting, no extended family coordination)

## FAQ: DAKboard vs Honeydew

### Q: Is Honeydew really better than DAKboard?

**A:** For most families, yes—because most families need help with coordination, not just display. Honeydew's AI agent, voice control, and mobile access save 3-5 hours per week. DAKboard shows your calendar beautifully but doesn't help you manage it. However, if you specifically want a customizable wall display and enjoy DIY projects, DAKboard is excellent at what it does.

### Q: Can I use both DAKboard and Honeydew together?

**A:** Absolutely! This is actually a great approach. Use Honeydew for AI-powered coordination and voice input. DAKboard automatically displays everything you create (via Google Calendar sync). You get beautiful wall presence AND smart coordination.

### Q: Is DAKboard free? Is Honeydew free?

**A:** DAKboard has a limited free tier, but useful features require Premium ($60-96/year). You also need hardware ($50-400). Honeydew has a fully functional free tier with basic AI, and Premium is $7.99/mo or $79/year with no hardware purchase required.

### Q: What's the biggest advantage of Honeydew over DAKboard?

**A:** The AI agent. Honeydew understands natural language requests like "plan our camping trip this weekend with packing list" and automatically creates events, tasks, and lists. DAKboard displays information—you still have to create it all yourself using other apps.

### Q: What's DAKboard's biggest advantage over Honeydew?

**A:** Customization and visual presence. DAKboard creates beautiful, personalized wall displays with photos, weather, news, and custom layouts. Honeydew has a standardized app interface optimized for function over form.

### Q: Which is better for divorced/co-parenting families?

**A:** Honeydew, without question. Its multi-family architecture lets co-parents share a coordinated "kids" group while maintaining separate household groups. DAKboard's single-display model can't coordinate across two households.

### Q: Does DAKboard have voice control?

**A:** No. DAKboard is display-only—it shows information but can't accept input. To add events, you need to use Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or another source app.

### Q: Can I use my existing TV with DAKboard?

**A:** Yes! DAKboard works with any HDMI display. You'll need a Raspberry Pi or similar device to run the software. This flexibility is one of DAKboard's genuine strengths.

### Q: Can I put Honeydew on a wall display?

**A:** Yes! Mount an old tablet on your wall and open Honeydew's web app. You get full functionality (AI, voice, lists) in a wall display format—essentially a "smart DAKboard" without additional hardware cost.

### Q: Is my family's data private with both services?

**A:** DAKboard offers self-hosted options for maximum privacy. Honeydew uses bank-level encryption and never sells data (see [privacy policy](https://www.gethoneydew.app/privacy)). Both take privacy seriously but have different approaches.

### Q: What if I'm not technical—can I set up DAKboard?

**A:** The pre-built DAKboard displays ($249-399) are plug-and-play. The DIY route requires moderate technical skills (Raspberry Pi setup, display configuration). Honeydew requires zero technical skills—download and use.

### Q: How long does each take to set up?

**A:** DAKboard DIY: 2-6 hours. DAKboard pre-built: 30-60 minutes. Honeydew: 5 minutes.

### Q: Which has better customer support?

**A:** Honeydew offers in-app support, email support, and a comprehensive help center. DAKboard has email support and community forums. Both are responsive, but Honeydew's in-app support is more immediate.

## The Bottom Line

**DAKboard and Honeydew solve different problems:**

- **DAKboard** creates a beautiful, customizable wall display that shows your calendar, photos, weather, and more. It's excellent for visual presence and DIY enthusiasts who want complete control over their display. But it's passive—it shows information without helping you manage it.

- **Honeydew** provides an AI-powered assistant that actively helps coordinate family chaos. It creates events, generates lists, understands voice commands, and works from anywhere. It's designed for busy families who need help with the work of coordination, not just visibility.

**Choose DAKboard if:**
- You want a beautiful wall display as a household centerpiece
- You enjoy DIY projects and customization
- You're home most of the time
- You have simple, single-family coordination needs
- You want weather, photos, and news alongside your calendar
- You already have spare hardware (TV, Raspberry Pi)

**Choose Honeydew if:**
- You want AI that actually helps coordinate (not just display)
- You need voice control for hands-free operation
- You coordinate across multiple family groups (co-parenting, extended family)
- You're tired of using 5+ apps for calendar, lists, tasks, and notes
- You want to save time, not just see your schedule
- You want zero hardware investment

**The hybrid approach:** Many families use both—DAKboard as a passive display showing photos and calendar, Honeydew as the active coordination tool. Everything you create in Honeydew appears on DAKboard via Google Calendar sync. Best of both worlds.
