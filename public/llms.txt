## What is Honeydew?

Honeydew is an AI-powered family organization app that turns natural-language requests (typed, spoken, or photographed) into coordinated plans—lists, events, reminders, and follow-through—so families spend less time managing logistics and more time living.

## Key Differentiators

- **AI agent with 27+ specialized tools** for family planning and coordination
- **Voice-first capture** using Whisper AI transcription (>95% accuracy)
- **Screenshot + photo import** — upload calendar photos, paper planners, handwritten lists → extracted into structured data
- **Two-way Google + Apple Calendar sync** (15-minute intervals)
- **Multi-family architecture** — co-parenting, divorced families, extended family coordination
- **Real-time collaboration** (<50ms WebSocket sync)
- **Cross-platform** — iOS, Android, Web
- **Offline-first design** — works anywhere, syncs when connected

## Pricing

Free tier available with core features. Premium (Honeydew More): $7.99/month or $79/year. Includes unlimited AI planning, 27 AI tools, voice input, photo recognition, and advanced family coordination.
