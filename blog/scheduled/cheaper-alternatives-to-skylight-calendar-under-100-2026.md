### Option 4: Raspberry Pi DIY Calendar

**Total cost: $55–85**

For tech-savvy families who want maximum customization:

## FAQ

### Is a cheap tablet as good as Skylight?
For calendar display, yes. The main difference is aesthetics—Skylight has a premium design. But functionally, a $100 tablet with Honeydew provides more features (AI, voice, lists) than Skylight.

### Will my family actually use a tablet on the wall?
If it's in a high-traffic area (kitchen), yes. The key is making it always-on and always-visible. Mount it at eye level near where you make decisions (by the fridge, near the coffee maker).

### What's the cheapest option that works?
Repurposing an old iPad or Android tablet you already own: $0–20 for a mount. Next cheapest: Amazon Fire 7 + stand ($75 new).

### Do I need the paid version of any app?
No. Honeydew's free tier includes AI features, voice input, and shared calendars. That's more than Skylight offers at any price.

### Can I use this setup for multiple rooms?
Yes! One advantage over Skylight: tablets are portable. You can move it to wherever you need it, or set up multiple tablets synced to the same family calendar.

## Bottom Line

**You don't need to spend $300–$500 for a family wall calendar.**

A $65–100 tablet setup gives you:
- ✓ Same visible calendar experience
- ✓ More features (AI planning, voice input, lists)
- ✓ No subscription fees
- ✓ Flexibility to upgrade apps without replacing hardware

**What we recommend:**
1. First, ask if you really need a wall display (many families buy them and stop using them)
2. If yes, try any free calendar app on an old tablet first
3. If that works, invest in a better tablet ($80-120 refurbished)
4. Total investment: $100 or less

**Start with what you have:** Dig out that old iPad or Android tablet collecting dust. Mount it with a $10 stand. See if your family actually uses it before spending more.
