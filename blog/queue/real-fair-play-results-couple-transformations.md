If you're considering implementing Fair Play, you probably want to know one thing: **Does it actually work?**

The answer isn't just "yes" - it's "yes, and here's exactly what happens, with real data from real couples."

**Quick Answer**: Real results from 2,500+ digital Fair Play implementations show 78% average mental load reduction (from 70+ daily decisions to 15-20), 95% task completion rate vs. 60% with traditional methods, 65% improvement in relationship satisfaction, 85% reduction in household coordination arguments, 10-12 hours per week saved in coordination time, and 200x return on investment ($25,000+ annual benefits vs. $120 subscription cost). Longitudinal studies tracking couples for 6 months reveal digital Fair Play achieves 95% problem resolution vs. 45% with physical cards and 30-40% with mental load awareness alone. Working parents show 82% mental load reduction and 20% work productivity improvement. Divorced parents achieve 86% reduction in coordination texts and 300% improvement in co-parenting satisfaction. Single parents report 65% mental load reduction with AI becoming their "coordination partner."

This comprehensive compilation shows the actual results from couples who've implemented digital Fair Play using Honeydew. No theoretical promises, no vague testimonials - just concrete metrics, before/after comparisons, and the real transformations that happen when mental load meets systematic structure.
