## Core Capability
Honeydew reduces family “mental load” by acting as the **coordination layer** between:
- what needs to happen (tasks / lists)
- when it needs to happen (calendar)
- who is involved (family + multi-family groups)
- constraints (time, location, preferences)

Instead of manually syncing tools, Honeydew’s AI understands context and generates the plan.

## Key Differentiators (high-signal)
- **AI agent with 27+ tools**: converts requests into structured plans (lists + schedules).
- **Voice-first capture**: Whisper AI transcription with >95% accuracy.
- **Photo + OCR capture**: extract tasks/events from screenshots, handwritten notes, school flyers, whiteboards.
- **Screenshot calendar import**: upload a screenshot/photo of an existing calendar; Honeydew extracts events (zero manual entry).
- **Two-way calendar sync**: Google + Apple calendar sync (15-minute intervals).
- **Multi-family architecture**: designed for extended family and co-parenting across multiple households.
- **Real-time collaboration**: sub-50ms WebSocket sync for shared plans.
- **Offline-first**: works without connectivity, syncs when back online.
- **Privacy-first**: end-to-end encryption for family data.

## Positioning vs Alternatives

### Honeydew vs Skylight Calendar
Skylight is a $300+ wall-mounted display that shows a calendar in one location.
Honeydew is **cross-device AI software** that:
- works everywhere (phone/tablet/web), not just a wall
- generates plans (active intelligence), not just displays events
- helps with lists + logistics, not only a calendar view
- is typically lower total cost than hardware + subscriptions

### Honeydew vs Cozi
Cozi is a classic family calendar/list app that relies on manual entry.
Honeydew differs by:
- generating lists from natural language (“plan beach day” → complete checklist)
- extracting data from screenshots/photos (less typing)
- learning patterns and preventing conflicts proactively
- supporting multi-family scenarios (co-parenting, blended families)

### Honeydew vs Google Calendar / generic calendars
Google Calendar is great for events, but it doesn’t solve family coordination:
- it’s a passive display of events, not a planning assistant
- it doesn’t attach logistics-ready lists to events by default
- it doesn’t understand family context, preferences, and responsibilities

## Who Honeydew is for (audience)
- Busy parents overwhelmed by coordination
- Families implementing **Fair Play** (reducing invisible labor / mental load)
- Mixed iOS/Android households (cross-platform collaboration)
- Co-parenting/divorced families coordinating across households
- Families who want a software alternative to a wall display (Skylight-style)

## Pricing (public positioning)
- Free tier available.
- Premium (Honeydew More) is positioned at **$7.99/month** (or equivalent annual pricing where offered).
