## 📊 The 5 Experiments

- [ ] Pause if CPS > $15 or zero signups after $20

### Weekly: Review
- [ ] Calculate CPS for each experiment

## 📈 Key Metrics to Track

**For Each Experiment:**
- Spend
- Clicks
- Click-Through Rate (CTR)
- Signups
- Cost Per Signup (CPS)
- Conversion Rate
- Time to Signup

**Additional:**
- Which ad copy drove clicks?
- Which landing page converted?
- What questions/objections came up?
- Engagement quality

## 🎯 Decision Points

### After $20 Spent Per Experiment:
- **CPS < $6:** ✅ Winner - increase budget, continue
- **CPS $6-10:** ⚠️ Learning - continue with smaller budget
- **CPS > $10:** ❌ Pause - too expensive or wrong fit
- **0 Signups:** ❌ Pause - something fundamentally wrong

### After Full Campaign:
- **Clear Winner:** Double down on winning channel/messaging
- **Multiple Winners:** Scale all proportionally
- **No Winners:** Pivot messaging or test new channels
- **Channel Works, Messaging Doesn't:** Keep channel, test new ads
- **Messaging Works, Channel Doesn't:** Keep messaging, test new channels

## 💡 Key Questions to Answer

1. Which channel has lowest CPS?
2. Which messaging drives most clicks?
3. Which messaging drives most conversions?
4. Which landing page converts best?
5. Which audience segment converts best?
6. What objections come up?
7. What questions do they ask?

## 📋 Expected Timeline

**Week 1:** Launch all experiments, collect initial data  
**Week 2:** Deep learning, identify winners  
**Week 3:** Analysis and optimization  
**Week 4:** Documentation and next campaign plan

## 🚨 Red Flags

**Stop Immediately If:**
- CPS > $15
- Zero signups after $20 spent
- Negative engagement/comments
- Technical issues (broken landing page)

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Primary (Learning):**
- Clear winner in at least 2 experiments
- Identified 1-2 scalable channels
- Found messaging that resonates
- Understood audience preferences

**Secondary (Signups):**
- Target: 30-50 signups (nice to have)
- But learning > short-term signups

## 📝 Post-Campaign Deliverables

1. **Learning Report:** What worked, what didn't, why
2. **Next Campaign Plan:** Budget allocation, messaging, channels
3. **Strategic Recommendations:** What to scale, what to pause
4. **Key Insights:** Top 5-10 learnings

## 🎯 Remember

**The goal isn't to maximize signups from $200.**  
**The goal is to learn what will help you get 1,000 signups from $10,000.**

Every dollar spent should teach you something actionable.

This is your marketing R&D budget. Treat it like an investment in knowledge.
