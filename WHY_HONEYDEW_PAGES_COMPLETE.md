## Honeydew's Core Value Props (Consistent Across All Pages)

"AI generates lists automatically in seconds" vs. 20-30 min manual entry

### 2. Voice Input
"Speak items hands-free while driving or cooking"

### 3. Photo Recognition
"Photograph handwritten lists, recipes, school papers"

### 4. No Hardware Required
Save $300-$700 on wall displays - works on devices you already own

### 5. Multi-Family Support
Critical for divorced parents managing multiple households

### 6. Two-Way Calendar Sync
Updates flow both directions with Google & Apple Calendar

### 7. Lists Attached to Events
Packing lists for trips, shopping lists for dinner parties - automatically linked

---

## Honest Competitive Positioning

Each page acknowledges when competitors make sense:

**Skylight/Hearth/Mango:** If you specifically want wall-mounted hardware display
**Cozi/FamilyWall:** If you prefer simple manual entry and lower cost
**TimeTree:** If calendar-only viewing is truly sufficient
**Google Calendar:** If free basics meet your needs
**Echo Show:** If you already own one for multi-purpose use

This builds trust and credibility while highlighting Honeydew's advantages for most families.

### 4. Track Conversions
Set up analytics to track:

### 5. Create Matching Ad Campaigns

- "Cheaper [Competitor] alternative"

### 6. Social Proof Badges (Optional)
Add trust elements:
