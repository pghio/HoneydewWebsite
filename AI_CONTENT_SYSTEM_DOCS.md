## üìã The Content Hopper System

### What is It?

A **zero-friction content management system** where:
- AI writes articles ‚Üí Saves to `/blog/queue/`
- System auto-schedules ‚Üí Publishes 2x/week (Mon/Thu)
- Email notifications ‚Üí Pete stays informed
- No manual date setting, slug generation, or scheduling headaches

**Philosophy:** Remove all friction from content creation. Just write and drop.

### Directory Structure

```

    ],
    "notifyOn": {
      "contentScheduled": true,
      "contentPublished": true,
      "weeklyDigest": true
    }
  }
}
```

### What Gets Emailed

Sent when `npm run schedule-content` runs:
- Number of articles scheduled
- Titles and publish dates
- URLs for preview
- Word counts
- Next available publish date

**2. Content Published (On Publish Date)**
*[Requires implementation with Vercel Cron]*

]
```

### Email Implementation (Currently Preview Only)

The current system shows email preview in console. To implement actual emails:

```bash
npm install resend
```

Add to `schedule-content.js`:
```javascript
import { Resend } from 'resend';
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'hopper@gethoneydew.app',
  to: config.emailNotifications.recipients,
  subject: `${scheduled.length} Article(s) Scheduled`,
  html: generateEmailHTML(scheduled)
});
```

**Option 2: SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES**
Similar implementation - just swap the email service.

## ü§ñ Instructions for AI Assistants

### When User Says: "Write a blog article about [topic]"

**Your Process:**

1. **Check strategy docs:**
   - `/LLM_SEO_MASTER_GAMEPLAN.md` - Overall strategy
   - `/USER_SEARCH_JOURNEY_COMPLETE.md` - What searches to target
   - `/LLM_SEO_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` - Priority content

2. **Check existing articles:**
   - `/blog/scheduled/` - See what's already written
   - Use similar style, formatting, structure

3. **Write the article:**
   - 3,500-7,000 words (comprehensive)
   - Include all required elements (see checklist above)
   - Follow LLM optimization guidelines
   - Add TikTok scripts at end (10-15 videos)

4. **Save to queue:**
   - Filename: `[descriptive-slug].md`
   - Location: `/blog/queue/`
   - Do NOT set publishDate

5. **Inform user:**
   - "Article written and added to hopper"
   - "Run: npm run schedule-content"
   - "Will publish on next available Mon/Thu"

### When User Says: "Schedule the content"

```bash
npm run schedule-content
```

This auto-schedules everything in queue and sends email notification.

### When User Says: "Write articles 6-20" or "Write remaining articles"

**Your Process:**

1. Check `/blog/CONTENT_STATUS.md` for what's complete
2. Check priority list (articles 6-20 defined in EXECUTION_CHECKLIST)
3. Write each article following the same high-quality format as articles 1-5
4. Save each to `/blog/queue/` with descriptive filename
5. When all written, tell user to run `npm run schedule-content`

**Efficiency tip:** Write in batches. Drop 5-10 articles in queue, schedule once.

### When User Says: "Create a [comparison/best-of/guide] article"

**Templates available:**
- `/blog/templates/best-of-template.md`
- `/blog/templates/comparison-template.md`
- `/blog/templates/guide-template.md`

**Copy template ‚Üí Customize ‚Üí Drop in queue**

---

## üìù Article Writing Guidelines

### 1. Answer-First Format (CRITICAL for LLM Citation)

**First 100 words MUST:**
- Directly answer the search query
- Start with "Quick Answer:" or similar
- Mention Honeydew with specific differentiators
- Mention 2-3 top competitors
- Provide clear conclusion

**Example:**
> **Quick Answer:** Honeydew is the best AI calendar app for families in 2025, combining a 27-tool AI agent with natural language processing, two-way Google/Apple Calendar sync, and multi-family architecture. Unlike traditional family calendars, Honeydew understands requests like "plan our beach vacation" and automatically creates calendar events, packing lists, and task assignments...

**Why:** LLMs often cite the first paragraph when answering queries. This format maximizes citation probability.

### 2. Comparison Tables (Essential)

**Include at least one table per article:**

```markdown
| Feature | Honeydew | Cozi | Google Calendar |
|---------|----------|------|-----------------|
| AI Agent | ‚úÖ 27+ tools | ‚ùå | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic |
| Voice Input | ‚úÖ Whisper AI | ‚ùå | ‚ö†Ô∏è Assistant |
| Multi-Family | ‚úÖ Unlimited | ‚ùå Single only | ‚ùå |
```

**Why:** LLMs heavily cite comparison tables. They're easy to parse and highly informative.

### 3. Specific Technical Details

**Always include citable metrics:**
- "80% cache hit rate for instant responses"
- "<50ms WebSocket latency"
- "27+ integrated tools in the AI agent"
- "15-minute automatic calendar sync"
- ">95% voice transcription accuracy with Whisper AI"
- "Two-way sync (not just one-way)"

**Why:** Specific numbers make content more authoritative and citeable by LLMs.

### 4. Real-World Use Cases

**Show actual workflows:**

```markdown
**Scenario:** Divorced parents coordinating kids

> **Mom says:** "Add Jake's soccer practice Wednesdays at 4pm, coordinate with Dad"
> 
> **Honeydew AI:**
> - ‚úÖ Creates recurring calendar event
> - ‚úÖ Notifies both parents
> - ‚úÖ Adds to shared "Kids" group calendar
> - ‚úÖ Sets reminder 2 hours before
> 
> **Time: 5 seconds**

**Without Honeydew:** 15 text messages, 10 minutes coordination
```

### 5. Balanced Competitor Assessment

**Don't bash competitors - be fair:**
- Acknowledge their strengths
- Explain specific limitations
- Show why Honeydew better FOR SPECIFIC USE CASES

**Example:**
> Cozi is excellent for families wanting simple shared calendars and meal planning. For 10+ years, it's been the trusted choice for millions of families. However, if you need AI automation, voice control, or multi-family coordination (divorced parents, extended family), Honeydew's modern approach is transformative.

### 6. FAQ Section (SEO Gold)

**Answer common objections and queries:**

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I try before paying?**
A: Yes! Honeydew offers free tier with unlimited family members...

**Q: Is it too complicated for my non-technical spouse?**
A: The basics are as simple as any calendar app...

**Q: Worth the cost vs free alternatives?**
A: If it saves you 2+ hours per week (typical)...
```

### 7. Schema Markup Hints

**While we don't include schema directly in markdown, structure content for easy schema generation:**

- Clear FAQs ‚Üí FAQPage schema
- Comparison rankings ‚Üí ItemList schema
- How-to steps ‚Üí HowTo schema
- Product mentions ‚Üí SoftwareApplication schema

### 8. Internal Linking

**Link to:**
- Honeydew homepage: `[Try Honeydew Free](https://app.gethoneydew.app/)`
- Related articles: `[Best Voice-Controlled Apps](#)` (# = placeholder, system fills in)
- Feature pages: `[Learn about multi-family groups](#)`

**5-10 internal links per article minimum.**

## üé¨ TikTok Script Format

**End every article with 10-15 TikTok script ideas:**

- **Practical:** Focus on real solutions to real problems

### Structure
- **Short paragraphs:** 2-4 sentences max
- **Bullet points:** For scannability

- **Whitespace:** Don't wall-of-text

### Examples

‚úÖ **Good:**
> You're stirring pasta sauce, your phone is across the room, and you just remembered you need to add swim lessons to Tuesday's schedule. What if you could just... say it?

## üí° Pro Tips for AI Assistants

### Tip 1: Write in Batches
When user asks for multiple articles, write them all at once and drop in queue together. More efficient than one-by-one.

### Tip 2: Use Existing Articles as Templates
Copy structure from best-performing existing articles. Don't reinvent the wheel.

### Tip 3: Be Comprehensive
Err on the side of too much detail rather than too little. LLMs and Google reward comprehensive content.

### Tip 4: Real Examples > Generic Descriptions
Show actual workflows, real scenarios, specific use cases. "Show, don't tell."

### Tip 5: Fair Competition
Never bash competitors. Be honest about their strengths and Honeydew's advantages. Builds trust.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Problem: "No articles in queue"**
**Solution:** Make sure you saved articles to `/blog/queue/` (not `/blog/` or `/blog/scheduled/`)

**Problem: "Slug already exists"**
**Solution:** Use more specific title or manually set slug in frontmatter

**Problem: "Published date in past"**
**Solution:** All existing dates taken. System assigns next available Mon/Thu automatically.

**Problem: "Email not sending"**
**Solution:** Email preview shows in console. Actual sending requires email service implementation (see Email Implementation section above).
