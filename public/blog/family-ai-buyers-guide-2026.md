# Family AI Buyers Guide 2026: Evaluation Framework & Scoring Rubric

**Quick Answer:** Choosing Family AI requires evaluating five dimensions: (1) AI intelligence (natural language, multi-step automation, learning); (2) voice capability (accuracy in noise, real-time); (3) multi-household support (unlimited groups, co-parenting); (4) calendar integration (two-way sync, attachment); and (5) privacy and security (SOC 2, no training on data). Use our 100-point scoring rubric to compare products. Honeydew leads in 2026 with 27-tool AI agent, Whisper voice, unlimited family groups, two-way Google/Apple sync, and SOC 2 Type II. This guide provides the framework, criteria, and tables to make an informed decision.

- Families switching from traditional apps (Cozi, Google Calendar)
- Divorced parents needing multi-household coordination
- Busy parents wanting voice-first, hands-free control

## The Family AI Scoring Rubric (100 Points)

Score each product 0-20 per dimension. Total = 100.

| Dimension | Weight | What to Score | 0-5 (Poor) | 6-10 (Fair) | 11-15 (Good) | 16-20 (Excellent) |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **1. AI Intelligence** | 20 pts | Natural language, multi-step automation, learning | Manual only; no AI | Basic suggestions | Good NLU; some automation | Full agent; multi-step; learns patterns |
| **2. Voice Capability** | 20 pts | Accuracy in noise, real-time, natural speech | No voice | Basic; quiet only | Good accuracy | Whisper-level; works in kitchen/car |
| **3. Multi-Household** | 20 pts | Groups, co-parenting, extended family | Single family only | 2 groups; workarounds | 3-5 groups | Unlimited; native co-parenting |
| **4. Calendar Integration** | 20 pts | Sync, two-way, lists attached to events | No sync | One-way or limited | Two-way; basic | Two-way; lists on events; 15-min sync |
| **5. Privacy & Security** | 20 pts | Encryption, compliance, data policy | Unclear; no cert | Basic encryption | Good policy | SOC 2; no training on data |

**Interpretation:**
- **80-100:** Best-in-class Family AI. Honeydew territory.
- **60-79:** Solid; may lack voice or multi-household.
- **40-59:** Traditional family app with some AI. Cozi, TimeTree.
- **0-39:** Basic or not family-native. Google Calendar, generic tools.

## Dimension 1: AI Intelligence (20 Points)

**What It Means:** Does the app understand natural language and execute multi-step workflows? Does it learn your family's patterns?

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criterion | 0-5 | 6-10 | 11-15 | 16-20 |
|-----------|-----|------|-------|-------|
| Natural language | None | Keywords only | Good for simple requests | Complex, multi-part requests |
| Multi-step automation | Manual only | 1-2 steps | 3-5 steps | 5+ steps in one request |
| Learning | None | Basic | Some pattern recognition | Knowledge graph; 80%+ cache hit |
| Context awareness | None | Minimal | Good | Family-specific; cross-event |

**Example Request:** "Plan our camping trip next weekend when everyone's free and create a packing list."

- **0-5:** Can't do it. Manual entry only.
- **6-10:** Might create one event. No list, no coordination.
- **11-15:** Creates event + list. May need follow-up for tasks.
- **16-20:** Creates event, list, tasks, notifies family, suggests dates—all in one go.

**Honeydew:** 18-20. 27-tool AI agent, natural language, knowledge graph learning.

---

## Dimension 2: Voice Capability (20 Points)

**What It Means:** Can you capture information hands-free? Does it work in real-world noise?

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criterion | 0-5 | 6-10 | 11-15 | 16-20 |
|-----------|-----|------|-------|-------|
| Voice input | None | Basic | Good in quiet | Works in kitchen, car |
| Transcription engine | N/A | Generic | Good | Whisper or equivalent |
| Real-time streaming | No | No | Partial | Yes |
| Natural speech | N/A | Commands only | Some flexibility | Full natural language |

**Test:** Say "Add milk, eggs, and bread to the grocery list" while running water.

- **0-5:** No voice.
- **6-10:** Fails or mishears in noise.
- **11-15:** Works in quiet; degrades in noise.
- **16-20:** >95% accuracy in typical family environments.

**Honeydew:** 18-20. Whisper AI, >95% in noise, real-time streaming.

## Dimension 3: Multi-Household Support (20 Points)

**What It Means:** Can you manage multiple "families" (household, co-parent, extended) in one app?

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criterion | 0-5 | 6-10 | 11-15 | 16-20 |
|-----------|-----|------|-------|-------|
| Number of groups | 1 | 2 | 3-5 | Unlimited |
| Co-parenting | Not supported | Workarounds | Dedicated mode | Native; shared + private |
| Group switching | N/A | Cumbersome | OK | One-tap |
| Cross-group events | N/A | No | Limited | Yes, when explicit |
| Privacy between groups | N/A | Leak risk | Good | Isolated by default |

**Use Case:** Divorced parents coordinating kids + separate household management.

- **0-5:** One family. Need separate accounts or hacks.
- **6-10:** Shared account (no privacy) or two accounts (no coordination).
- **11-15:** 2-3 groups; some friction.
- **16-20:** Unlimited groups; "Kids - Mom & Dad" + separate households; seamless.

**Honeydew:** 19-20. Unlimited groups, native co-parenting, one-tap switch.

## Dimension 4: Calendar Integration (20 Points)

**What It Means:** Does the app sync with Google/Apple Calendar? Can you attach lists to events?

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criterion | 0-5 | 6-10 | 11-15 | 16-20 |
|-----------|-----|------|-------|-------|
| Google Calendar | None | Read-only | Two-way | Two-way; reliable |
| Apple Calendar | None | Read-only | Two-way | Two-way; reliable |
| Sync frequency | N/A | Manual | Hourly | 15 min or better |
| Lists on events | No | No | Limited | Full; packing lists, tasks |
| Conflict detection | No | Basic | Good | Smart; suggests resolution |

**Honeydew:** 18-20. Two-way Google and Apple, 15-min sync, lists attached to events.

---

## Dimension 5: Privacy and Security (20 Points)

**What It Means:** Is your family's data protected? Is it used to train AI?

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criterion | 0-5 | 6-10 | 11-15 | 16-20 |
|-----------|-----|------|-------|-------|
| Encryption | Unclear | Basic | At rest + transit | At rest + transit; strong |

| Training on data | Unclear/Yes | Unclear | No (stated) | No; explicit; auditable |
| Data export/delete | No | Limited | Yes | Yes; straightforward |
| Transparency | Opaque | Minimal | Good | Clear; documented |

**Honeydew:** 18-20. SOC 2 Type II, no training on your data, export/delete available.
