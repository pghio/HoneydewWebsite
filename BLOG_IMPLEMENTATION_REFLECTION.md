## üìà SEO & Content Strategy

### Article Structure
Each article follows the template:
1. **Hook**: Relatable scenario (3 AM smoke detector, triple-booking)
2. **Problem Definition**: Research-backed pain point analysis
3. **Traditional Solutions**: Why current approaches fail
4. **AI Solution**: Specific example of how Honeydew works
5. **Results**: Real metrics with honest attribution
6. **Technical Explanation**: How the AI actually works
7. **Real Talk**: Adjustment periods and limitations
8. **Practical Usage**: Day-to-day reality
9. **Getting Started**: Actionable steps
10. **Bottom Line**: Key insight and reflection

### Keyword Optimization
Primary keywords integrated naturally:
- "AI family organization"
- "reduce mental load"
- "multi-generational care coordination"
- "AI meal planning"
- "family activity scheduling"
- "preventive home maintenance"

### Backlink Strategy
Each article cites reputable sources:
- American Psychological Association
- Pew Research Center
- Harvard Business Review
- National Institutes of Health

## üí° What Works Well

### 1. **Metric Transparency**
Real numbers with honest attribution:
- "86% reduction in coordination time"
- "100% elimination of missed appointments (and yes, I was the main offender)"
- "$1,390/year saved on home repairs"

### 2. **Personal Stories**
Authentic failure stories that readers relate to:
- The Great Furnace Failure ($850 repair)
- Triple-Booking Incident (disappointed kid, flaked commitments)
- 2:47 AM smoke detector battery adventure

### 3. **Technical Detail**
Shows the AI actually works without being overly technical:
```
Request: "Plan camping trip next weekend"
‚Üì
AI Processing (3 seconds):
- Creates 25+ item packing list
- Adds calendar event
- Generates meal plan
- Creates shopping lists
- Sets reminders
```

### 4. **Honest Limitations**
- "I'm not going to pretend this was seamless"
- "Week one, I was still manually checking everything"
- "The AI is only as good as the information you give it"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations & Workarounds

### 1. **Full Article Content**

**Action**: Implement react-markdown or similar library

### 2. **Images/Screenshots**
**Current State**: No visual assets yet  
**Workaround**: Article structure supports images  
**Action**: You need to provide the assets listed in previous feedback

### 3. **CMS Integration**
**Current State**: Hardcoded in component  
**Workaround**: Easy to migrate to Contentful/Sanity later  
**Action**: Current approach is fine for 5 articles

### 4. **Search Functionality**
**Current State**: No search within blog  
**Workaround**: Only 5 articles, browsing is fine
