# Cozi Gold Price 2026: Is $29.99/Year Worth It? (Honest Review)

**Quick answer:** Cozi Gold costs **$29.99/year** in 2026. You get ad-free experience, birthday tracker, shopping mode, and extra features. But here's the honest assessment: Cozi Gold is worth it **only if** you (1) already love Cozi's manual-entry approach, (2) don't need AI planning, voice input, or multi-household coordination, and (3) want the cheapest paid family organizer. For families wanting more automation, AI assistants like **Honeydew** ($7.99/mo or $79/yr) offer dramatically more value per dollar—AI-generated lists, voice capture, and multi-family support that Cozi doesn't provide at any price tier.

## Is Cozi Gold Worth $29.99/Year?

### ✅ Yes, if you:
- Already use Cozi Free and love the interface
- Find the ads genuinely annoying
- Want the cheapest possible paid family organizer
- Don't need AI, voice, or multi-household features
- Only use Google Calendar (not Apple)

### ❌ No, if you:
- Spend more than 30 min/week on manual list-making

- Coordinate with divorced co-parent, grandparents, or multiple families
- Use Apple Calendar and need two-way sync
- Want the app to help plan, not just display

## Cozi Gold vs Honeydew: Value Comparison

| Metric | Cozi Gold | Honeydew More |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Annual cost | $29.99 | $79/year |
| Monthly cost | ~$2.50 | $7.99/mo (or ~$6.58/mo annual) |
| Time saved/week (estimated) | 15–30 min (ad removal, small conveniences) | 2–5 hours (AI planning, voice capture) |
| Value ratio | Convenience upgrade | Workflow transformation |

**The math:** If your time is worth $25/hour and you actually use AI planning 2+ hours/week, the ROI math works out. But many families don't need that much planning automation—Cozi Gold may be the better fit if your needs are simpler. The value proposition depends entirely on your family's complexity.

### Is Cozi Gold worth it in 2026?
It depends on your needs. If you love Cozi's interface and just want to remove ads, it's worth $30/year. If you want AI automation, voice input, or multi-family coordination, consider alternatives like Honeydew that offer more value for slightly higher cost.

## Bottom Line

**Cozi Gold at $29.99/year is fair value for what it is:** a convenience upgrade to a manual-entry family organizer. But "fair value" isn't the same as "best value."

If you're evaluating family apps in 2026, the question isn't "Is Cozi Gold worth $30?" It's "What do I actually need?"

- **If you need:** Simple shared calendar + lists with no AI → Cozi Gold is fine.
- **If you need:** AI planning, voice capture, multi-family coordination → Honeydew offers dramatically more capability.

**Try Honeydew free:** No credit card required. [Get started](https://app.gethoneydew.app/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog_cta&utm_campaign=article_conversion&utm_content=cozi-gold-price-2026)
