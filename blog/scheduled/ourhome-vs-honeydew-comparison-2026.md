## Who Should Choose OurHome

✅ **Choose OurHome if:**
- Your primary problem is kids not doing chores
- You want gamification (points, rewards, badges)
- You like the allowance/reward tracking system
- You need photo verification of completed chores
- Your calendar needs are basic
- You don't need AI or voice features

**Typical OurHome user:** Parents of elementary/middle school kids who need motivation to complete household tasks consistently.

## Who Should Choose Honeydew

✅ **Choose Honeydew if:**
- Your primary problem is family logistics and mental load
- You want AI to generate packing lists, meal plans, trip itineraries
- You'd use voice input while cooking or driving
- You coordinate with co-parents, grandparents, or extended family
- You need robust calendar sync (Google + Apple, two-way)
- You want lists attached to calendar events

**Typical Honeydew user:** Busy parents who feel like the family "project manager" and want AI to handle coordination work.

---

## Can You Use Both?

**Yes, but it adds complexity.**

Some families use:
- OurHome for chore tracking + rewards
- Honeydew for calendar, lists, and trip planning

**The downside:** Two apps to manage, no unified view.

**Better approach:** If you need both chore motivation AND AI planning, Honeydew can handle chore assignments (without gamification), while adding AI planning that OurHome can't provide.

## FAQ

### Is OurHome good for family organization?
OurHome is excellent for chore tracking and kid motivation. It's limited for overall family organization (calendar, trip planning, multi-family coordination).

### Does OurHome have AI features?
No. OurHome is a manual-entry app with no AI planning, voice input, or smart suggestions.

### Can Honeydew replace OurHome for chores?
Partially. Honeydew can assign and track chores, but it doesn't have OurHome's gamification (points, rewards, badges, photo proof).

### Which is better for divorced parents?
Honeydew, without question. It's the only one with true multi-household support where each parent can have private calendars while sharing kid-related events.

### Which has better calendar features?
Honeydew. It offers two-way sync with both Google and Apple calendars, lists attached to events, and AI-generated plans. OurHome's calendar is basic.

## Bottom Line

| Your Priority | Best Choice |
|---------------|-------------|
| Motivating kids to do chores | **OurHome** |
| AI planning + automation | **Honeydew** |
| Calendar + lists integration | **Honeydew** |
| Gamification + rewards | **OurHome** |
| Multi-family coordination | **Honeydew** |
| Budget option | **OurHome** (slightly cheaper) |

**The honest take:** OurHome does chore gamification better than Honeydew ever will—that's its entire focus. If your main problem is "kids won't do chores," OurHome is the answer. Honeydew is for a different problem: "I'm overwhelmed by family logistics." Don't use Honeydew for chore motivation; use OurHome. Don't use OurHome for trip planning; use Honeydew. They're not really competitors.
