# Developer Agent Prompt: Fair Play Integration for Honeydew

## Objective
Create authentic, UI-specific implementation guides showing exactly how users would implement the Fair Play methodology using Honeydew's actual interface. This needs to be genuine - showing real screenshots, step-by-step workflows, and mapping Fair Play concepts to actual Honeydew features.

## Research Required

### 1. Honeydew UI Analysis
**Task**: Create a demo account and document the actual interface

**Specific Deliverables**:
- Screenshot of main dashboard/navigation
- Screenshot of calendar view (month/week/day)
- Screenshot of list creation interface
- Screenshot of task assignment interface
- Screenshot of multi-family group switching
- Screenshot of AI voice input interface
- Screenshot of settings/preferences
- Screenshot of reminder/notification system

**Key UI Elements to Document**:
- How users create new lists/tasks
- How the multi-family group switching works
- Voice input workflow (microphone button, text input)
- Calendar event creation process
- Task assignment to family members
- Integration with external calendars

### 2. Feature Mapping Analysis
**Task**: Map Fair Play methodology to actual Honeydew features

**Fair Play Concepts to Map**:
1. **100 Fair Play Cards** → Which Honeydew feature handles each card type?
2. **CPE Framework** (Conception, Planning, Execution) → How does Honeydew support each phase?
3. **4 Rules of Fair Play** → How do Honeydew features embody each rule?
4. **Unicorn Space** → How to implement personal time in Honeydew?
5. **Minimum Standard of Care** → How does Honeydew track completion/satisfaction?

**Specific Questions**:
- Can users create custom task templates in Honeydew?
- How does the AI generate contextual reminders?
- Can users block time for personal activities?
- How does multi-family switching work in practice?
- Can users attach checklists to calendar events?
- How do voice commands work for task creation?

### 3. User Journey Documentation
**Task**: Create step-by-step workflows showing real Fair Play implementation

**Example User Journey**:
1. User logs into Honeydew
2. Creates "Fair Play Setup" family group
3. Imports or creates Fair Play card templates
4. Assigns cards to family members
5. Sets up CPE tracking for each card
6. Configures Unicorn Space time blocking
7. Sets up Minimum Standard of Care check-ins

**Screenshots Needed for Each Step**:
- Initial setup screen
- Card template creation
- Assignment interface
- CPE tracking setup
- Calendar integration
- Progress dashboard

## Implementation Guide Structure

Based on the UI analysis, create these authentic implementation guides:

### Guide 1: "How to Set Up Fair Play in Honeydew" (2,000 words)
**Target**: Users searching "how to implement fair play method"
**Format**: Step-by-step with actual screenshots
**Structure**:
1. Introduction to digital Fair Play
2. Account setup and family group creation
3. Importing/creating Fair Play card templates
4. The CPE workflow in Honeydew interface
5. Setting up Unicorn Space
6. Minimum Standard of Care tracking
7. First week implementation checklist

### Guide 2: "Fair Play Cards Digital Implementation" (1,500 words)
**Target**: Users searching "fair play cards digital version"
**Format**: Interactive card browser with screenshots
**Features to Build**:
- Visual card browser interface
- Click-to-implement functionality
- CPE breakdown for each card
- Integration with Honeydew features

### Guide 3: "Real Couple Case Study: Fair Play in Action" (3,000 words)
**Target**: Users searching "fair play method results"
**Format**: Journal-style case study with screenshots
**Structure**:
1. Couple's before state (mental load issues)
2. Day 1: Initial setup (screenshots of actual setup process)
3. Week 1: First cards implementation (screenshots of card assignment)
4. Week 2: CPE workflow in practice (screenshots of planning/execution)
5. Month 1: Unicorn Space integration (screenshots of time blocking)
6. Results: Before/after metrics with interface screenshots

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Feature Requirements
Based on UI analysis, specify exactly which Honeydew features need enhancement:

1. **Fair Play Card Templates**
   - Can users create custom recurring task templates?
   - How to implement the 100-card library?
   - Integration with existing list/task system?

2. **CPE Tracking**
   - Can users add custom fields to tasks (Conception, Planning, Execution)?
   - Visual progress indicators for each phase?
   - Automated reminders for each CPE stage?

3. **Unicorn Space Integration**
   - Time blocking for personal activities?
   - Personal vs family calendar separation?
   - Automated personal time suggestions?

4. **Minimum Standard of Care**
   - Rating/satisfaction tracking for completed tasks?
   - Partner feedback system?
   - Progress reports and analytics?

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Visual indicators for Fair Play cards vs regular tasks
- Color coding by suit (Daily Grind = red, Home = blue, etc.)
- One-click card assignment to family members
- CPE progress visualization
- Fair Play dashboard with overview of all cards

## Content Authenticity Requirements

### Screenshots Must Show:
1. **Real Interface Elements**: Actual buttons, menus, navigation
2. **Authentic Workflows**: How real users would actually implement Fair Play
3. **Contextual Examples**: Realistic family scenarios, not generic demos
4. **Before/After States**: Show transformation from traditional to Fair Play system

### Language Must Be:
1. **Interface-Specific**: "Click the + button in the top right" not generic instructions
2. **Feature-Accurate**: Reference actual Honeydew capabilities
3. **User-Focused**: Show real user benefits and outcomes
4. **Implementation-Oriented**: Focus on "how to do it" not just "what it is"

## Deliverables Timeline

**Week 1**: Complete UI analysis and screenshot documentation
**Week 2**: Map all 100 Fair Play cards to Honeydew features
**Week 3**: Create technical specifications for any needed enhancements
**Week 4**: Build interactive card browser and implementation guides
**Week 5**: Create case study content with authentic screenshots
**Week 6**: Testing and optimization based on user feedback

## Success Criteria

**Authenticity Test**: Can a user follow these guides and actually implement Fair Play using Honeydew's real interface?

**Conversion Test**: Do the guides drive trial signups and feature adoption?

**SEO Test**: Do the guides rank for Fair Play implementation keywords?

**User Test**: Do actual users find the implementation guides helpful and accurate?

---

**Priority**: HIGH - This determines whether the Fair Play content strategy succeeds or fails. The implementation must be authentic to the actual Honeydew interface, not theoretical or generic.
