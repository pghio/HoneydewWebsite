## üö® Top 10 AI-Generated Content Red Flags

1. **FAQ answers 200-400 words each** (should be 50-100 words)
2. **Repetitive competitor mentions** in every FAQ answer (Cozi/Skylight)
3. **Generic opening scenario** in every blog article ("It's Tuesday evening...")
4. **"Quick Answer" sections that are 150+ words** (not quick!)
5. **Identical structure across all 8 comparison pages** (obvious template)
6. **Overuse of buzzwords:** "Revolutionary," "enterprise-grade," "dramatically," "brilliantly"
7. **Vague taglines:** "The family organizer that thinks" (what does that mean?)
8. **Feature descriptions all follow same pattern:** [Tech spec]. [Example]. [Time metric].
9. **Token competitor advantages** that don't feel genuine ("Simple, familiar interface")
10. **Every comparison page has "RECOMMENDED" badge** (loses credibility)

## üé≠ Before/After Examples

### Example 1: FAQ Answer

**Before (AI-generated, 400 words):**
> "After reading Eve Rodsky's 'Fair Play' book, my wife and I had a breakthrough moment about the mental load of family management. The book brilliantly outlined how to distribute household tasks fairly, but we quickly realized that while Fair Play gave us the framework for equitable task distribution, existing family organization apps like Cozi and Skylight Calendar weren't sophisticated enough to truly solve the problem. Cozi felt like a glorified to-do list that still required constant manual updates, and Skylight Calendar was limited to a wall-mounted display that couldn't adapt to our dynamic family life. We tried every family planner app, household management tool, and smart calendar on the market, but nothing actually reduced the cognitive burden - they just digitized it..."

**After (Human voice, 40 words):**
> "My wife and I loved the Fair Play framework, but existing apps like Cozi still left us drowning in manual work. We built Honeydew to use AI to handle the mental load, not just digitize it."

**Impact:** Feels authentic, gets to the point, still mentions Fair Play but naturally

---

### Example 2: Hero Section

**Before (Generic AI buzzwords):**
> "In just three seconds Honeydew turns one sentence into 25-40 organized items, with calendars, smart lists, and reminders linked automatically. Type it, say it, or photograph it‚Äîour AI understands your family and keeps everyone in sync."

**After (Specific, concrete):**
> "Say 'plan camping trip' and get a complete packing list with calendar event‚Äîin 3 seconds. Type it, speak it, or photograph it. Honeydew handles the details."

**Impact:** More concrete, less jargon, clearer value proposition

---

### Example 3: Feature Description

**Before (Technical jargon):**
> "Knowledge Graph Learning: 80% cache hit rate for instant responses. Learns your family patterns and gets smarter with every use - sub-500ms for cached requests."

**After (Human benefit):**
> "Remembers Your Routines: Honeydew learns that 'soccer practice' means packing cleats, water bottle, and healthy snack‚Äîand reminds you automatically next time."

**Impact:** Shows benefit, not technical specs

## üìû Questions to Consider

Before implementing changes, ask yourself:

1. **Does this sound like me or like AI marketing copy?**
2. **Would I actually say this to a friend?**
3. **Is this specific and concrete or vague and buzzwordy?**
4. **Am I showing real value or just listing features?**
5. **Would I trust this if I were a visitor?**

---

**Bottom Line:**

Your website has excellent bones but needs a human voice transplant. The technical work is solid‚Äînow make the copy feel like it came from a person who genuinely cares about solving real problems for real families.

You're 80% of the way there. These refinements will get you to 95%+.
