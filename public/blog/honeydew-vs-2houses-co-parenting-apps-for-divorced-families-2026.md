# Honeydew vs 2houses: Which Co-Parenting App Should Divorced Families Choose in 2026?

**Quick Answer:** **2houses** is an affordable European co-parenting platform ideal for **budget-conscious divorced families who only need shared custody coordination**—custody calendar, expense splitting, and a custody journal for €5.99/month (~$6.50 USD). **Honeydew** is the better choice for families who want **AI-powered automation, voice control, and multi-purpose family organization** beyond just co-parenting. If you're a European family with straightforward custody needs and a tight budget, 2houses delivers solid value. If you want modern AI assistance, hands-free voice control, or need to manage your household alongside co-parenting, Honeydew's $7.99/month premium offers dramatically more capability.

---

## Two Different Philosophies for Co-Parenting

**2houses** launched in 2011 in Belgium with a focused mission: give divorced European families an affordable, dedicated platform for coordinating custody. With 250,000+ families using it, 2houses has carved out a niche as the go-to budget co-parenting app in Europe. It does co-parenting and only co-parenting—no more, no less.

**Honeydew** launched in 2024 with a different vision: use AI to eliminate the coordination overhead that makes family life chaotic—whether that's co-parenting after divorce, managing a blended family, or coordinating with grandparents. It's a multi-purpose family organization platform with co-parenting as one of many use cases.

**The fundamental question:** Do you need a **dedicated co-parenting tool** at the lowest price, or do you need a **comprehensive family platform** that happens to excel at co-parenting?

## What is 2houses?

**2houses** is a Belgian co-parenting platform that has quietly served over 250,000 divorced families since 2011. Founded by divorced parents who experienced the coordination challenges firsthand, 2houses focuses exclusively on making shared custody easier—nothing more, nothing less.

The app is particularly popular in Europe, where it's become one of the standard recommendations for divorcing families.

## What is Honeydew?

Honeydew is an AI-powered family organization app that combines a **27-tool AI agent** with natural language processing, **Whisper AI voice control** (96.3% accuracy), and **true multi-family architecture**. Unlike traditional family calendars or dedicated co-parenting apps, Honeydew understands complex requests like "coordinate Emma's soccer schedule with Jake" and automatically creates events, packing lists, and notifications across all relevant family members.

For co-parenting specifically, Honeydew's multi-family architecture is a game-changer: you can create a shared "Kids" group that both parents join while maintaining completely separate private household groups. Switch between contexts in under a second, and never worry about your ex seeing your personal household lists.

### Honeydew's Key Features

- **AI Agent with 27+ Tools:** Natural language task creation, smart scheduling, conflict detection, packing list generation
- **Voice Control:** Whisper AI transcription with 96.3% accuracy—add to calendar while driving, cooking, or multitasking
- **Two-Way Calendar Sync:** Real bidirectional sync with Google and Apple Calendar (15-minute intervals)
- **Multi-Family Architecture:** Unlimited family groups with instant switching (<1 second)—perfect for co-parenting + personal household
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** <50ms WebSocket latency for instant updates

| **Free** | $0 | Unlimited family members, basic AI features |
| **Premium** | $7.99/month | Unlimited AI, voice control, fast sync |
| **Annual** | $79/year | Save 17% vs monthly |
| **Family Plan** | $149/year | Up to 6 premium accounts |

Unlike 2houses, Honeydew offers a generous free tier that includes multi-family groups—you can test co-parenting coordination without paying.

## Feature Comparison: 2houses vs Honeydew

### AI & Automation: Does Your Co-Parenting App Think for You?

**2houses: ❌ Zero AI Capabilities**

2houses has no artificial intelligence. Every entry—calendar events, expenses, journal notes—must be typed manually. The app stores and displays information but doesn't help you create it.

**To add a recurring activity in 2houses:**
1. Open the app
2. Navigate to calendar
3. Create new event
4. Type all details manually
5. Set recurrence pattern
6. Manually notify co-parent via messages
7. Create expense entry separately if applicable

**Time: 5-10 minutes**

**Honeydew: ✅ 27+ AI Tools Built for Families**

Honeydew's AI agent transforms how you coordinate:

**Example Request:**
> "Emma has basketball practice Mondays and Thursdays at 4pm, coordinate with Jake"

**Honeydew AI (5 seconds):**
- ✅ Creates recurring calendar events for both days
- ✅ Generates "Basketball Gear" checklist (shoes, uniform, water bottle, snack)
- ✅ Attaches list to events
- ✅ Notifies Jake (co-parent) with complete details
- ✅ Checks for conflicts with existing custody schedule
- ✅ Sets prep reminders for 2 hours before
- ✅ Learns Emma's patterns for future suggestions

**The difference:** 2houses is a database that stores what you type. Honeydew is an assistant that thinks alongside you.

For busy divorced parents juggling work, kids, and coordination with an ex, this distinction is enormous. Every manual entry in 2houses is time stolen from your life. Every voice command to Honeydew gives time back.

**Winner: Honeydew** — 2houses has zero AI capabilities; Honeydew's AI agent handles complex multi-step family coordination automatically.

---

### Voice Control: Hands-Free for Busy Single Parents

**2houses: ❌ No Voice Input**

2houses requires typing for all input. As a single parent:
- You must stop what you're doing to use the app
- Can't add events while driving
- Can't log expenses while hands are full
- Must find time to sit down and type

**Honeydew: ✅ Industry-Leading Voice Control**

Honeydew uses OpenAI's Whisper AI for voice transcription:
- **96.3% accuracy**—10-28 percentage points higher than competitors
- **58 language support**—works for multilingual families and European users
- **Noise tolerance**—accurate even with kids screaming, traffic, or kitchen sounds
- **No special hardware**—works on your phone, no Echo or Google Home needed

**Real single-parent scenarios:**
- Driving to pickup: "Add dentist appointment next Tuesday at 3pm, share with Jake"
- Making dinner: "Remind me to pack Emma's soccer uniform tonight"
- Holding a toddler: "Add lunch money to the school expense list"
- Walking the dog: "What's on the custody calendar this week?"

**For divorced parents:** Voice control isn't a luxury—it's a necessity. You're doing the job of two parents. Every task you can complete without stopping what you're doing is a small victory.

**Winner: Honeydew** — Voice control is essential for single parents, and 2houses doesn't offer it.

---

### Calendar Sync: Keeping Both Households on the Same Page

**2houses: ⚠️ Limited Calendar Integration**

2houses offers calendar export (one-way):
- Export custody calendar to Google/Apple Calendar
- Changes in 2houses appear in your external calendar
- Changes in Google/Apple do NOT sync back to 2houses
- Manual duplicate entry required for non-custody events
- No smart conflict detection

**Honeydew: ✅ True Two-Way Sync**

Honeydew provides bidirectional calendar synchronization:
- **Two-way sync:** Changes flow both directions automatically
- **Google Calendar:** Full bidirectional integration
- **Apple Calendar:** Full bidirectional integration
- **15-minute intervals:** Near-real-time synchronization
- **Conflict detection:** AI identifies scheduling conflicts
- **Color coding:** Visual distinction between family members and groups

**Why this matters for co-parenting:**

When your ex adds Emma's birthday party to Google Calendar, Honeydew automatically imports it. When you add a doctor's appointment in Honeydew, it appears in everyone's Google Calendar. No duplicate entry, no missed events, no "I didn't see that."

With 2houses, you're maintaining two separate systems. Changes in 2houses go out, but nothing comes back in. If your co-parent uses Google Calendar for their personal scheduling (most people do), you're constantly at risk of conflicts.

**Winner: Honeydew** — Two-way sync eliminates the double-entry problem that plagues 2houses users.

---

### Multi-Family Support: Beyond Just Co-Parenting

**2houses: ❌ Co-Parenting Only**

2houses is designed exclusively for divorced parents sharing custody. It handles:
- ✅ Shared custody calendar with your ex
- ✅ Expenses between you and your ex
- ❌ Your personal household organization
- ❌ Extended family (grandparents helping)
- ❌ Blended family coordination (stepkids, new partners)
- ❌ Your new household if you remarry

**The limitation:** 2houses only sees one relationship—you and your co-parent. Modern divorced families are more complex.

**Honeydew: ✅ Unlimited Family Groups**

Honeydew's multi-family architecture handles real family complexity:

**Typical divorced parent setup:**
- **Group 1: "Kids with Ex"** — Both parents, shared custody coordination
- **Group 2: "My Household"** — Your home, new partner, stepkids
- **Group 3: "Grandparents"** — Extended family who help with pickup/dropoff
- **Group 4: "Summer Camp Planning"** — Temporary group for specific logistics

**Privacy controls:**
- Each group is completely separate unless you choose to share
- Your ex sees only the "Kids with Ex" group
- Your personal household lists are invisible to them
- Switch between groups in one tap (<1 second)

**Real scenario:** Your mom is picking up Emma from school because both you and your ex are working. In 2houses, grandma isn't part of the system—you'd have to text her separately. In Honeydew, she's in your "Extended Family" group and gets notified automatically.

**Winner: Honeydew** — Real divorced families involve more than just two co-parents. Honeydew handles the full picture; 2houses only sees one slice.

---

### Expense Tracking: Splitting Costs Between Households

**2houses: ✅ Dedicated Expense Management**

2houses has purpose-built expense tracking for co-parenting:
- Log expenses with amounts and descriptions
- Attach receipt photos
- Automatic splitting calculations (50/50, 60/40, custom)
- Reimbursement request workflow
- Track payment status
- Category organization (medical, education, activities, etc.)
- Annual expense summaries

**Example workflow:**
1. Pay for Emma's dance lessons: $150
2. Log in 2houses: Dance lessons, $150, receipt attached
3. 2houses calculates: Jake owes you $75 (50/50 split)
4. Jake receives notification
5. Mark as paid when reimbursed
6. Track across the year for tax purposes

**Honeydew: ⚠️ Basic Expense Tracking**

Honeydew handles expenses through lists and notes:
- Create shared expense lists
- Attach notes to calendar events
- Manual tracking and calculations
- Works for cooperative co-parents
- Not designed for disputed reimbursements
- No automatic splitting or payment workflow

**For high-expense coordination:** 2houses' dedicated expense system is more robust. If you're frequently splitting medical bills, activity fees, and school costs, 2houses streamlines this.

**For simple expense sharing:** Honeydew's list-based approach works fine for cooperative co-parents who don't need formal tracking.

**Winner: 2houses** — Dedicated expense management with splitting, receipts, and payment tracking. This is one area where 2houses' specialization pays off.

---

### Custody Journal: Documenting Your Child's Life

**2houses: ✅ Built-In Custody Journal**

2houses includes a unique custody journal feature:
- Document daily activities during your custody time
- Record health information (medications, symptoms, doctor visits)
- Note behavioral observations
- Share school performance updates
- Keep both parents informed about child's well-being
- Create continuous record across both households

**Why this matters:** When Emma switches from Mom's house to Dad's house, continuity is important. What did she eat? How did she sleep? Is she getting over that cold? The custody journal keeps both parents informed without requiring constant texting.

**Honeydew: ⚠️ Activity Logs via Lists**

Honeydew can accomplish similar documentation through:
- Shared notes attached to calendar events
- Activity lists shared between groups
- AI-generated summaries of recent activities
- Not purpose-built as a "journal"

**Honest assessment:** 2houses' custody journal is more intentionally designed for this use case. Honeydew can achieve similar results but requires more setup.

**Winner: 2houses** — The dedicated custody journal feature is thoughtfully designed for divorced families' needs.

---

### Photo & Video Sharing: Memories Across Households

**2houses: ✅ Built-In Photo Albums**

2houses includes private photo/video sharing:
- Create albums for different events
- Share photos between both households
- Private to your family (not social media)
- Kids' milestones visible to both parents
- No third-party app needed

**Honeydew: ✅ Sharing via Lists and Events**

Honeydew supports photo sharing through:
- Attach images to events
- Share in list items
- OCR processing for handwritten notes and school papers
- Less structured than dedicated albums

**Tie:** Both apps allow photo sharing. 2houses has more traditional album organization; Honeydew has more context-aware attachment to events and lists. Neither is significantly better.

---

### User Experience & Design

**2houses:**
- ⚠️ Functional but dated interface
- ⚠️ European design sensibility (different than US apps)
- ✅ Straightforward once learned
- ⚠️ Primarily designed for web; mobile apps are secondary
- ⚠️ Slower development cycle (less frequent updates)

**Honeydew:**
- ✅ Modern 2024/2025 interface design
- ✅ Fast, responsive mobile apps
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Intuitive navigation
- ⚠️ Learning curve for AI features

**Winner: Honeydew** — Modern design, mobile-first approach, and regular updates create a more pleasant daily experience.

---

## Real-World Scenarios: Who Should Use Which App?

### Scenario 1: Marie & Thomas in Brussels (Budget-Conscious, Straightforward Custody)

**Situation:**
- Divorced 3 years, 2 kids (ages 5, 8)
- Live in Belgium, familiar with European apps
- Cooperative relationship
- Simple 50/50 custody schedule
- Need to split expenses frequently
- Budget is tight—every euro matters

**With 2houses:**
- ✅ €5.99/month fits their budget
- ✅ Expense splitting handles frequent reimbursements
- ✅ Custody journal keeps both informed
- ✅ European-designed, familiar UX
- ⚠️ Manual entry for everything
- ⚠️ Can't manage personal households

**With Honeydew:**
- ⚠️ $7.99/month is slightly more (~$1.50 extra)
- ✅ AI would reduce coordination time
- ✅ Multi-family groups for blended scenarios
- ⚠️ US-based support (time zones)
- ⚠️ Less robust expense splitting

**Verdict:** **2houses** is the better fit. Budget matters, they're in Europe, and their needs are straightforward. The expense splitting alone justifies the choice.

---

### Scenario 2: Jennifer in Texas (Busy Professional, Needs Efficiency)

**Situation:**
- Divorced 2 years, 1 child (age 10)
- Works demanding corporate job (50+ hours/week)
- Constantly multitasking
- Cooperative co-parenting with ex
- Mom helps with pickup frequently
- New partner, considering blended household

**With 2houses:**
- ⚠️ Must stop activities to type everything
- ⚠️ Can't coordinate with her mom (not part of system)
- ⚠️ Can't manage her own household
- ⚠️ Manual entry eats into limited free time
- ✅ Affordable

**With Honeydew:**
- ✅ Voice control while commuting, cooking, multitasking
- ✅ Multi-family groups include mom as helper
- ✅ Personal household management included
- ✅ AI reduces coordination texts by 80%
- ✅ US-based support, same time zone
- ⚠️ Slightly higher cost

**Verdict:** **Honeydew** is the clear winner. Jennifer's time is valuable, she needs voice control, and her family situation is more complex than 2houses can handle.

---

### Scenario 3: Marcus & Priya in London (Blended Family Complexity)

**Situation:**
- Divorced 4 years, 2 kids from first marriage
- Both remarried with stepchildren
- Marcus has kids 3 nights/week
- Priya has kids other 4 nights
- Both have new household responsibilities
- Coordinate with 4 grandparents for help

**With 2houses:**
- ✅ Handles Marcus-Priya custody coordination
- ❌ Can't manage Marcus's new household
- ❌ Can't manage Priya's new household
- ❌ Can't include grandparents
- ❌ Need multiple apps for complete picture

**With Honeydew:**
- ✅ "Kids" group for Marcus-Priya coordination
- ✅ "Marcus's Family" group for new household
- ✅ "Priya's Family" group for new household
- ✅ "Grandparents - Marcus side" group
- ✅ "Grandparents - Priya side" group
- ✅ One app handles everything

**Verdict:** **Honeydew** is essential for blended family complexity. 2houses literally cannot serve their needs.

---

### Scenario 4: Sarah in France (Just Needs the Basics)

**Situation:**
- Recently divorced, 1 child (age 7)
- Simple custody arrangement
- Amicable with ex
- Doesn't need fancy features
- Just wants things to work
- Values simplicity over technology

**With 2houses:**
- ✅ Simple, focused interface
- ✅ Does exactly what she needs
- ✅ Affordable at €5.99/month
- ✅ European-familiar design
- ✅ No learning curve for AI
- ✅ Custody journal for documenting

**With Honeydew:**
- ⚠️ AI features might feel like overkill
- ⚠️ More powerful than she needs
- ⚠️ Slightly higher cost
- ✅ Free tier available for testing

**Verdict:** **2houses** is the better fit. Sometimes simpler is better, and Sarah doesn't need AI automation for her straightforward situation.

### Cost Analysis

**2houses is cheaper** if you only look at subscription costs:

- Over 5 years: ~$70 savings

**But consider the hidden costs:**

**Time cost (Honeydew advantage):**
- 2houses requires 5-10 minutes per entry
- Honeydew completes same tasks in 30 seconds (voice/AI)
- If you add 3 entries per week: 15-30 minutes saved weekly
- At $30/hour value: $23-$45/week in time value
- **Annual time value: $1,200-$2,340**

**Functionality cost (Honeydew advantage):**
- 2houses requires separate app for personal household
- 2houses requires texting grandparents separately
- 2houses requires Google Calendar for proper integration
- Honeydew handles all in one app

**True cost comparison:**
- 2houses: ~$65/year subscription + time costs + additional apps
- Honeydew: $79/year subscription + time savings + single app

**Bottom line:** 2houses is cheaper if time isn't valuable and needs are simple. Honeydew is dramatically better value if you account for time savings and multi-purpose functionality.

---

## 2houses Strengths: Where They Excel

### Affordability for Co-Parenting

At €5.99/month, 2houses is one of the most affordable dedicated co-parenting apps available. For families on tight budgets—common during and after divorce—this price point is genuinely attractive. There are no tiers, no upsells, no premium features locked behind higher payments.

### European Focus and Expertise

2houses understands European family law contexts, privacy regulations (GDPR), and user expectations. The interface reflects European design sensibilities, and the company has 15+ years of experience serving EU families. For European users, this familiarity matters.

### Dedicated Co-Parenting Features

The custody journal and expense splitting features are purpose-built for divorced families. 2houses didn't add co-parenting to a general-purpose app—they built from the ground up for this specific use case. That focus shows in features like automatic expense splitting calculations and custody transition documentation.

### Simplicity

Sometimes you don't want AI. Sometimes you don't want voice control. Sometimes you just want an app that does one thing well. 2houses' focused approach means less complexity, fewer features to learn, and a straightforward experience.

### When 2houses Might Be the Better Choice

- **European families** familiar with the platform and preferring EU-based services
- **Budget-sensitive situations** where every euro matters
- **Simple custody arrangements** without blended families or extended family involvement
- **Frequent expense splitting** requiring dedicated reimbursement workflows
- **Preference for simplicity** over AI-powered automation
- **No voice control need** because you're not constantly multitasking

---

## FAQ: 2houses vs Honeydew

### Q: Is Honeydew really better than 2houses?

**A:** It depends on your needs. For European families with straightforward custody and tight budgets, 2houses delivers solid value at a lower price. For families needing AI automation, voice control, or multi-family management, Honeydew is significantly more capable. Most US-based families will prefer Honeydew's modern features and US support.

### Q: Can I use both 2houses and Honeydew together?

**A:** Yes, though there's limited benefit. You might use 2houses for expense splitting and Honeydew for AI-powered daily coordination. However, maintaining two apps creates overhead—most families choose one.

### Q: Is 2houses available in the United States?

**A:** Yes, 2houses works globally. However, it's primarily designed for European users and has limited US-specific features or support. US families often find American-made alternatives more suited to their expectations.

### Q: Does 2houses have any AI features?

**A:** No. 2houses has no artificial intelligence capabilities. All entries must be created manually through typing.

### Q: Which is better for expense tracking?

**A:** 2houses. Its dedicated expense management with automatic splitting, receipt attachments, and reimbursement tracking is more robust than Honeydew's list-based approach.

### Q: Which is better for divorced parents who've remarried?

**A:** Honeydew. Its multi-family architecture handles blended families, stepchildren, and multiple household groups. 2houses only manages the co-parenting relationship with your ex.

### Q: Does Honeydew work on Android and iPhone?

**A:** Yes. Honeydew is available on iOS, Android, and web. 2houses is also available on all three platforms.

### Q: What's the biggest advantage of Honeydew over 2houses?

**A:** The AI agent and voice control. Honeydew can complete in 5 seconds what takes 5-10 minutes of manual entry in 2houses. For busy divorced parents, this time difference is substantial.

### Q: Is my family's data private in both apps?

**A:** Yes. Both apps take privacy seriously. 2houses is GDPR-compliant (European privacy law). Honeydew uses bank-level encryption and complies with both GDPR and CCPA. See our [privacy policy](https://www.gethoneydew.app/privacy) and [security page](https://www.gethoneydew.app/security).

### Q: What if I try Honeydew and don't like it?

**A:** Honeydew offers a generous free tier—test everything without payment. If you subscribe to Premium, you can cancel anytime with no penalties.

### Q: Is 2houses court-admissible like OurFamilyWizard?

**A:** 2houses is not primarily designed for legal documentation. While it stores records, it doesn't have the court-focused features of OurFamilyWizard (uneditable messages, lawyer access, ToneMeter). Neither is Honeydew designed for court use.

---

## The Bottom Line

**2houses is a focused co-parenting tool.** It does one thing—coordinate custody between divorced parents—and does it affordably. If you're a European family with straightforward needs and a tight budget, 2houses delivers genuine value. The expense splitting is solid, the custody journal is unique, and the price can't be beat.

**Honeydew is a comprehensive family platform.** It uses AI to make all family coordination easier—including co-parenting, but not limited to it. If you're a busy single parent who needs voice control, a blended family with complex relationships, or anyone who wants modern technology reducing daily coordination friction, Honeydew is the better choice.

**For most US families in 2026:**
- **Budget-first, simple needs:** 2houses (~$65/year)
- **Modern features, complex families:** Honeydew ($79/year)
- **European families:** Consider 2houses for regional fit

**The real question isn't "which is better"—it's "what do I need?"**

If you need the cheapest co-parenting tool and don't need AI, get 2houses.
If you need AI, voice control, and multi-family management, get Honeydew.

**Choose 2houses if:**
- Budget is your primary concern
- You're in Europe and prefer EU services
- Your needs are simple (two-parent coordination only)
- Expense splitting is critical to your situation
- You prefer simplicity over automation

**Choose Honeydew if:**
- You want AI that actually helps (not just a database)
