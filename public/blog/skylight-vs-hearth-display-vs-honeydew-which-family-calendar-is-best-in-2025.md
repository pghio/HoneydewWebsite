# Skylight vs Hearth Display vs Honeydew: Which Family Calendar Is Best in 2025?

**Quick Answer:** For most families, **Honeydew** (free or $7.99/mo) is the best choice—AI planning, voice control, and no hardware needed. If you specifically want a wall display, **Skylight Calendar** ($299 + $79/yr) offers the best value. **Hearth Display** ($549-$699) is only worth it for design-obsessed families with budget to spare. Here's why:

| Feature | Skylight | Hearth Display | Honeydew |
|---------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Price** | $299 + $79/yr | $549-$699 + sub | Free–$7.99/mo |
| **Hardware** | 15" touchscreen | 27" touchscreen | Your phone/tablet |
| **AI Planning** | ❌ None | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Advanced |
| **Voice Control** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ Whisper AI |
| **Multi-Family** | ❌ Single | ❌ Single | ✅ Unlimited |
| **Portability** | Wall only | Wall only | Everywhere |
| **Best For** | Budget display | Premium display | Modern families |

## Why Families Are Comparing These Three

The family calendar market has exploded, with three distinct approaches:

1. **Skylight Calendar** — The "original" dedicated family display ($299)
2. **Hearth Display** — The premium, design-forward competitor ($549+)
3. **Honeydew** — The AI-powered, software-only alternative (free/$7.99)

Each takes a fundamentally different approach to family organization. Let's break down which is right for you.

## Skylight Calendar: The Budget Hardware Option

**Price:** $299 hardware + $79/year for Plus features 
**What it is:** A 15" touchscreen display that mounts on your wall

### What Skylight Does Well

✅ **Simple setup** — Mount, connect WiFi, sync calendars 
✅ **Family photo display** — Shows photos when not viewing calendar 
✅ **Color-coded family members** — Each person gets their color 
✅ **Reliable and focused** — Does one thing: calendar display

### Skylight's Limitations

❌ **No AI or smart features** — Manual entry for everything 
❌ **No voice control** — Must tap the screen 
❌ **One-way calendar sync** — Changes don't flow back to Google/Apple 
❌ **Single family only** — Can't manage divorced parent households 
❌ **Fixed location** — Stays on your wall, doesn't travel 
❌ **Subscription creep** — $79/year for features that should be included

### Who Should Choose Skylight

- Families wanting a dedicated display without breaking the bank
- Simple households with one family unit
- Non-technical families wanting "set it and forget it"
- Anyone who prioritizes the wall display aesthetic

**Total 3-year cost:** $299 + ($79 × 3) = **$536**

## Cost Analysis: 3-Year Total Ownership

| Scenario | Skylight | Hearth | Honeydew |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Upfront cost** | $299 | $549-$699 | $0 |
| **Year 1 subscription** | $79 | ~$60 | $0-$96 |
| **Year 2 subscription** | $79 | ~$60 | $0-$96 |
| **Year 3 subscription** | $79 | ~$60 | $0-$96 |
| **3-Year Total** | **$536** | **$729-$879** | **$0-$288** |

**Honeydew saves $248-$879 over 3 years** compared to hardware options.

### But What About the Value of Time?

- 156 hours × 3 years = **468 hours saved**
- Value at $20/hour = **$9,360 worth of time**

Even the most expensive Honeydew plan ($288 over 3 years) delivers **32x ROI** on time savings.

## Real Family Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Smiths (Traditional Family)

**Family:** 2 parents, 2 kids, one household, moderate budget

**Needs:**
- See family schedule at a glance
- Coordinate kids' activities
- Shared grocery list

**Best Choice: Skylight** — Gets the job done at reasonable cost. Hardware provides the "always visible" calendar they want. No complex needs that require AI.

**Alternative: Honeydew + wall-mounted iPad** — Same visibility, plus AI features, but requires setup.

---

### Scenario 2: The Chens (Tech-Savvy Family)

**Family:** 2 working parents, 3 kids, smart home, value technology

**Needs:**
- Modern family coordination
- Voice control while multitasking
- Integration with busy schedules
- AI to reduce coordination work

**Best Choice: Honeydew** — AI planning and voice control are essential for this family. Wall display is nice but not necessary when they're always on phones anyway. Time savings justify subscription.

---

### Scenario 3: The Garcias (Divorced Parents)

**Family:** 2 households, 2 kids, co-parenting coordination

**Needs:**
- Share kids' schedules across both homes
- Privacy for each household's personal calendar
- Reduce coordination texts/calls
- Both parents see the same information

**Best Choice: Honeydew** — **Only option that works.** Skylight and Hearth both limit you to single-family use. Honeydew's multi-family groups solve this perfectly.

---

### Scenario 4: The Andersons (Design-Forward Home)

**Family:** 2 adults, 1 child, smart home enthusiasts, premium budget

**Needs:**
- Beautiful wall display that matches decor
- Control smart home devices
- Family calendar secondary to aesthetics
- Money is not a concern

**Best Choice: Hearth Display** — This is exactly who Hearth is built for. The 27" display is gorgeous, smart home control is valuable, and they can afford the premium.

---

### Scenario 5: The Millers (Budget-Conscious)

**Family:** Single parent, 2 kids, tight budget

**Needs:**
- Free or very cheap solution
- Basic calendar and list sharing
- Works on existing devices

**Best Choice: Honeydew Free Tier** — Unlimited family members, 50 AI requests/month, calendar sync, lists—all free. Hardware displays are out of budget.

## FAQ: Skylight vs Hearth vs Honeydew

### Which is best for divorced parents?

**Honeydew is the only option.** Both Skylight and Hearth only support single-family households. Honeydew's multi-family architecture lets you create a "Kids - Mom & Dad" shared group while each parent maintains their own private household group.

### Can I use my iPad as a family display instead of buying Skylight?

Yes! Mount an iPad on the wall, install Honeydew (or any calendar app), and you get a family display with MORE features than Skylight:
- AI planning (Skylight: none)
- Voice control (Skylight: none)
- Two-way sync (Skylight: one-way only)
- Portable when needed (Skylight: wall-mounted only)

**Cost:** Old iPad ($100-200 used) + Honeydew (free-$96/yr) < Skylight ($378 first year)

### Is Hearth Display worth 2x the price of Skylight?

For most families: **No.** The extra $250-$400 gets you:
- Bigger screen (27" vs 15")
- Smart home controls
- Better design

Unless smart home control is important to you, Skylight delivers Most the value at 50% the cost.

### Why doesn't Skylight or Hearth have AI?

Hardware displays launched before AI became accessible. Adding AI requires:
- Cloud processing (subscription costs)
- Voice hardware (microphones, speakers)
- Software development (LLM integration)

This is why **software-first approaches like Honeydew can iterate faster** than hardware companies.

### What if I want a wall display AND AI features?

**Solution:** Mount a tablet + use Honeydew

1. Get an iPad or Android tablet ($100-500)
2. Get a wall mount ($20-50)
3. Install Honeydew (free-$7.99/mo)
4. Use always-on display mode

**Total cost:** $120-550 + $0-96/yr 
**Features:** Everything Skylight has + AI + voice + multi-family

This "DIY family hub" approach gives you the best of both worlds.

### Can Skylight or Hearth sync with multiple calendars?

Yes, both can display multiple Google/Apple calendars. But:
- Sync is **one-way only** (calendar → display)
- Changes on the display don't sync back
- No cross-calendar conflict detection

Honeydew syncs **two-way** with full change propagation.

### Which has the best customer support?

- **Skylight:** Good support, established company, responsive
- **Hearth:** Newer company, smaller team, growing
- **Honeydew:** Responsive startup, active development, feature requests heard

All three have acceptable support. Hardware companies (Skylight, Hearth) have more to lose from returns, so they're motivated to help.

---

## Bottom Line: Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Skylight Calendar if:
✅ You specifically want a dedicated wall display 
✅ Budget is moderate ($300-500 total) 
✅ Simple needs: calendar + photos 
✅ Single-family household 
✅ Don't need AI or voice control

### Choose Hearth Display if:
✅ Design and aesthetics are top priority 
✅ You're building a smart home hub 
✅ Budget is not a concern ($700+) 
✅ Single-family household 
✅ Want the most premium hardware experience

### Choose Honeydew if:
✅ You want AI to reduce coordination work 
✅ Voice control is important (multitasking parents) 
✅ You have a modern family structure (divorced, extended, multiple groups) 
✅ Budget matters (free tier is genuinely useful) 
✅ You value portability (phone always with you) 
✅ Two-way calendar sync is important

---

## Our Recommendation

**For Most families: Honeydew is the better choice.**

The era of dedicated family displays (Skylight, Hearth) is ending. Modern families need:
- AI that reduces coordination overhead
- Voice control for multitasking
- Multi-family support for modern family structures
- Portability (your calendar should travel with you)

Hardware displays are nice-to-have. AI coordination is need-to-have.

**If you truly want a wall display:** Get a cheap tablet + Honeydew. You'll get everything Skylight offers plus AI, voice, and multi-family—for similar or lower cost.
