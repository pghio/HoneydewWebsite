## FAQ

### What's the best free AI meal planner?
Honeydew's free tier includes AI meal planning. Mealime's free version is also good but more limited. Eat This Much has a free tier focused on individual nutrition.

### Can AI create meal plans for picky eaters?
Yes. With Honeydew, specify "one picky eater who only eats chicken and pasta" and AI generates plans accommodating that. Other apps offer filtering but less flexibility.

### Do meal planning apps create grocery lists?
Most do. Honeydew, Mealime, Eat This Much, and Paprika all auto-generate grocery lists from meal plans. Quality varies—Honeydew's AI consolidates ingredients intelligently.

### Which app works best with family calendars?
Honeydew is the only meal planner that integrates meals into your family calendar, so you see dinner plans alongside activities and schedules.

### Is it worth paying for AI meal planning?
If you meal plan weekly, saving 1-2 hours per week justifies $5-8/month for most families. Free tiers are good for trying AI features before committing.

## Bottom Line

| Priority | Best Choice |
|----------|-------------|
| Best AI + family integration | **Honeydew** |
| Quick weeknight dinners | **Mealime** |
| Nutrition/macro tracking | **Eat This Much** |
| Recipe collection | **Paprika** |
| Recipe discovery | **Yummly** |
| Simple manual planning | **Plan to Eat** |

**Our recommendation:** If meal planning is your *main* need, Mealime is actually more focused and might serve you better. Honeydew's strength is integration—meals + calendar + coordination in one system. If you already have a calendar solution you like, a dedicated meal planner (Mealime, Eat This Much) might be the better add-on.
