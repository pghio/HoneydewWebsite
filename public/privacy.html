    <h1>Honeydew Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: November 11, 2025</p>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Honeydew ("Honeydew", "we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes
        how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use Honeydew. If you have questions, contact us at
        <a href="mailto:pete@gethoneydew.app">pete@gethoneydew.app</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This Policy applies to information collected through the Honeydew application and related websites located at
      <a href="https://gethoneydew.app/">gethoneydew.app</a>. It does not apply to third-party websites or services that we do not control.
    </p>

    <h2>Plain-Language AI Notice</h2>
    <p>
      Honeydew uses OpenAI’s API to interpret your requests, orchestrate tools, and draft responses. While the assistant is designed to provide accurate, family-ready recommendations, AI outputs may be imperfect or require review. Our team and automated filters continuously moderate prompts and responses to keep conversations safe and aligned with our community standards.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Information</strong>: Email, family name, and profile details you provide when creating or updating an account.</li>
      <li><strong>Family/Workspace Data</strong>: Household relationships, roles, lists, items, routines, preferences, reminders, files, and other content you create inside Honeydew.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Interaction Data</strong>: Prompts, chat transcripts, voice commands, generated responses, and attachments you share with Honeydew’s AI assistant.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage & Diagnostics</strong>: In-app interactions, device type, app version, logs, and crash reports used to maintain reliability, security, and performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Voice & Media Input (optional)</strong>: Audio captured for voice commands, transcripts produced by Whisper AI, and media you choose to upload (e.g., family photos or receipts).</li>
      <li><strong>Calendar Data (optional)</strong>: If you connect Google Calendar or Apple Calendar, we access read-only event data necessary to display schedules in Honeydew and associate items. This includes event metadata (IDs, etags, titles, start/end times, location, attendees if present) and sync tokens.</li>
      <li><strong>Contacts (optional)</strong>: Names and email addresses you choose to share so Honeydew can coordinate events or send invitations.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics Logs</strong>: Aggregated metrics, page views, and feature usage captured through Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to understand product performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Support, Feedback & Deletion Requests</strong>: Information you provide when contacting support, submitting feedback, or using the in-app Delete My Data flow. We record deletion requests to document completion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Process AI Data</h2>
    <p>
      Honeydew uses trusted infrastructure and third-party processors to power AI features. Prompts, transcripts, and related metadata are sent securely to
      <strong>OpenAI</strong> (text, image, and tool orchestration) and <strong>AWS</strong> (hosting, storage, and real-time sync). Voice inputs are transcribed using Whisper AI.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>AI responses are generated on external servers; no personal data is used to train foundation models.</li>
      <li>Conversation snippets are cached for up to <strong>30 days</strong> to provide context, after which they are automatically deleted unless you pin them.</li>
      <li>Moderation filters screen user inputs and AI outputs for unsafe or disallowed content before responses are delivered.</li>
      <li>We log minimal metadata (timestamp, request type, latency) to monitor quality and abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining security logs and complying with legal obligations.

      When you submit a deletion request, we remove active data within <strong>7 days</strong> and roll encrypted backups off our systems within <strong>35 days</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Deletion Workflow</h2>
    <p>
      Honeydew offers self-serve deletion so you stay in control of your data:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Open Settings → Privacy → Delete My Data</strong> in the Honeydew app to start the request.</li>
      <li><strong>Confirm via email</strong>: We send a verification email to ensure the request is legitimate. Follow the link to finalize the deletion.</li>
      <li><strong>Removal window</strong>: We delete active records within <strong>7 days</strong> and confirm completion via email. Encrypted backups roll off within <strong>35 days</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow-up</strong>: If you do not receive confirmation, reply to the email or contact <a href="mailto:pete@gethoneydew.app">pete@gethoneydew.app</a>. We log deletion requests to verify resolution.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use industry-standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information. This includes encrypted transport (TLS 1.2+), encryption at rest for stored data, and strict authentication controls via Firebase Authentication. Access to production systems is limited to trained personnel, and sensitive content is never used to train external models. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>AI Safety &amp; Moderation</h2>
    <p>
      Honeydew applies automated and human-reviewed safeguards to prevent unsafe or abusive use of AI features. Inputs and outputs may be analyzed for moderation purposes consistent with our Terms of Service, and our team may review flagged content to improve safety. If you encounter harmful content, please report it via in-app feedback or email.
    </p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      We may process information in the United States and other countries where we or our providers operate.
      Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.
    </p>

    <h2>Children &amp; Shared Families</h2>
    <p>
      Honeydew is designed for parents, guardians, and caregivers coordinating household responsibilities. Guardians control which family members are invited, what data is shared, and may create child profiles to view schedules without granting direct account access. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice as appropriate.
      The “Effective date” above reflects the latest version.
