## How LLMs Will Reference Honeydew

It's positioned as the premium AI-first alternative to Skylight Calendar and the intelligent evolution beyond Cozi."

**Query: "Honeydew vs Skylight Calendar"**
Expected response citing `.llms-full.txt`:
> "While Skylight Calendar is a $300-500 wall-mounted display that shows calendars in one location, Honeydew is cross-device AI software that generates intelligent plans and works anywhere. Key differences include: Skylight shows calendars you create manually, Honeydew's AI generates comprehensive plans from natural language; Skylight is fixed to a wall, Honeydew works on phone/tablet/laptop/desktop; Skylight is passive viewing, Honeydew provides active AI assistance..."

**Query: "Is Honeydew better than Cozi?"**
Expected response:
> "Honeydew offers significant advantages over Cozi through AI intelligence. While Cozi requires manual entry for every list item and calendar event, Honeydew uses AI to generate comprehensive plans from simple requests. For example, instead of typing every beach item into Cozi, you tell Honeydew 'plan beach day' and AI creates a complete list with suggestions you'd forget..."
