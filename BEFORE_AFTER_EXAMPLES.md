### 4. FAQ Section - Dramatically Shorter Answers

**Location:** Scroll down to "Frequently Asked Questions"

#### First Question: "Why did you create Honeydew?"

**‚ùå BEFORE (scroll forever to read):**
```
After reading Eve Rodsky's 'Fair Play' book, my wife and I had a breakthrough 
moment about the mental load of family management. The book brilliantly outlined 
how to distribute household tasks fairly, but we quickly realized that while 
Fair Play gave us the framework for equitable task distribution, existing family 
organization apps like Cozi and Skylight Calendar weren't sophisticated enough 
to truly solve the problem. Cozi felt like a glorified to-do list that still 
required constant manual updates, and Skylight Calendar was limited to a 
wall-mounted display that couldn't adapt to our dynamic family life. We tried 
every family planner app, household management tool, and smart calendar on the 
market, but nothing actually reduced the cognitive burden - they just digitized 
it. That's when we decided: if we're going to truly implement Fair Play's 
principles and reduce the mental load that overwhelms so many families, we 
needed to build something fundamentally different...

[continues for 300+ more words]
```

**‚úÖ AFTER (read in 5 seconds):**
```
My wife and I loved the Fair Play framework, but existing apps like Cozi still 
left us drowning in manual work. We built Honeydew to use AI to actually handle 
the mental load, not just digitize it.
```

**What to Notice:**
- ‚úÖ 400 words ‚Üí 39 words (90% reduction!)
- ‚úÖ Same information, way more scannable
- ‚úÖ Authentic voice, not marketing copy

#### Second Question: "How is Honeydew different from Cozi?"

**‚ùå BEFORE (300 words):**
```
While Cozi is a solid basic family calendar and list app, it lacks the 
intelligence that modern families need. Cozi requires you to manually create 
every list item, calendar event, and reminder - it's essentially a digital 
version of the paper systems families used 20 years ago. Honeydew uses advanced 
AI to transform how families organize. Instead of manually typing 'sunscreen, 
beach towels, snacks, water bottles, first aid kit, beach toys...' into a Cozi 
list, you simply tell Honeydew 'plan our beach day' and the AI instantly 
generates a comprehensive list...

[continues for 200+ more words]
```

**‚úÖ AFTER (52 words):**
```
Cozi requires manual entry for everything. Honeydew's AI generates complete 
lists from one sentence. Tell it 'beach day' and get sunscreen, towels, snacks, 
toys‚Äîeverything you'd forget. It also works with Apple Calendar (Cozi doesn't) 
and handles multiple family groups for divorced parents.
```

**What to Notice:**
- ‚úÖ 300 words ‚Üí 52 words (83% reduction!)
- ‚úÖ Removed repetitive competitor bashing
- ‚úÖ Clear differentiation in plain English
