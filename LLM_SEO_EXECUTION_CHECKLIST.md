## ðŸ“ž Need Help? Decision Trees

### "I don't have budget for full team"
â†’ Start with:
- 1 contract writer (3-4 articles/month)
- DIY video content (phone camera + simple editing)
- Manual schema markup (free)
- Focus on highest-ROI content only

### "I don't have time for 100+ articles"
â†’ Prioritize:
- 10 "Best of" articles (highest traffic potential)
- 10 comparison pages (highest conversion potential)
- 10 use case deep dives (highest value demonstration)
- Everything else is nice-to-have

### "I'm not sure which content to prioritize"
â†’ Start with:
1. Your 3 strongest differentiators (AI agent, multi-family, voice)
2. Highest search volume keywords (best family apps, AI family planner)
3. Highest conversion intent (comparison pages, how-to guides)

### "I'm not seeing results"
â†’ Check:
- Is content actually high quality? (not thin/generic)
- Is technical SEO sound? (schema, speed, mobile)
- Are you actually promoting content? (not just publishing)
- Are you tracking the right metrics?
- Have you given it enough time? (6+ months for SEO)
