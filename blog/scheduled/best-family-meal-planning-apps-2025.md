## The "What's for Dinner?" Problem

It's 5:30 PM. You're tired. Kids are hungry. Partner texts: "What's for dinner?"

**You have no idea.**

Sound familiar? The "what's for dinner" question is among the most dreaded daily decisions for families.

**The meal planning promise:**
- Know what you're cooking ahead of time
- Groceries already bought
- No 5pm panic
- Less food waste
- Healthier eating

**The meal planning reality:**
- You plan for Monday, forget by Wednesday
- Plans don't account for schedule changes
- Ingredients bought, never used

## Tips for Sustainable Meal Planning

### 1. Start with 3 Days, Not 7

Don't over-plan:
- Plan Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
- See how it goes
- Add more days when comfortable

### 2. Have 5-10 "Default" Meals

Meals you can always make:
- Ingredients common
- Family likes them
- Quick to prepare
- Rotate these with new experiments

### 3. Theme Nights (Optional)

Reduces decisions:
- Taco Tuesday
- Pasta Wednesday
- Pizza Friday
- Kids cook Saturday

### 4. Account for Schedule

Don't plan elaborate dinner on:
- Late activity nights
- Both parents working late
- After-school chaos days

Plan slow cooker or quick meals accordingly.

### 5. Embrace Leftovers

Plan for leftovers:
- Sunday roast → Monday sandwiches
- Taco meat → Tuesday taco salad
- Less cooking, less waste

## The "Decision Fatigue" Reality

The problem with "what's for dinner" isn't cooking—it's **deciding**.

**Standard meal planning apps** require you to:
- Browse recipes
- Decide what sounds good
- Check what you have
- Plan the week
- Generate list
- Shop accordingly

**AI-powered approach** (Honeydew):
- Tell AI your constraints
- AI suggests meals
- You approve or adjust
- Done in 60 seconds

**The decision is made for you.** You just cook.

---

## The Bottom Line

**If meal planning is your primary challenge:** Mealime provides the best dedicated experience with excellent recipes and grocery integration.

**If you want meal planning integrated with family life:** Honeydew's AI suggestions and calendar integration make meal planning part of overall family organization.

**If you're a recipe collector:** Paprika excels at organizing your recipe library with meal planning on top.

**If you need inspiration:** Yummly's recommendation engine surfaces meals you'll love.

The best meal planning app is the one you'll actually use. Consider your cooking style, organizational preferences, and whether you want a dedicated planner or integrated family management.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can Honeydew store recipes?**
A: You can save recipes as notes or links attached to meal events. For extensive recipe storage, Paprika or Mealime are better. Honeydew excels at planning and suggesting, not recipe database.

A: Tell it! "Suggest dinners for family of 4, kids are picky, prefer chicken and pasta, avoid spicy food." AI factors your constraints into suggestions.

**Q: What about nutritional tracking?**
