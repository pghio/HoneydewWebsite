# AI Ethics for Families: Questions Before Using Family AI (2026)

**Quick Answer:** Before adopting Family AI, ask: (1) Who has access to our data, and is it used to train AI? (2) Does everyone in the family consent to participation? (3) Are we overrelying on AI for decisions we should make ourselves? (4) How does this affect screen time and family presence? (5) What are we modeling for our kids about technology and agency? Reputable Family AI apps (e.g., Honeydew) use encryption, SOC 2 compliance, and do not train on your data. Consent and overreliance are family decisions. This guide provides a practical framework—not prescriptions—for responsible adoption.

## Why Ethics Matter for Family AI

Family AI sees your schedules, preferences, and coordination patterns. It influences how your family makes decisions and spends time. Getting the ethics right isn't optional; it's part of being a thoughtful parent. This guide offers questions, not answers. Your family's values will shape your choices.

## The Five Ethical Dimensions

| Dimension | Core Question | What to Consider |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| 1. Privacy & Data | Who sees our data, and how is it used? | Encryption, training policies, retention |
| 2. Consent | Does everyone agree to participate? | Adults, kids, extended family |
| 3. Agency & Overreliance | Are we outsourcing decisions we should make? | Review, override, critical thinking |
| 4. Presence & Screen Time | Does AI help or hurt family connection? | Intentional use, boundaries |
| 5. Modeling for Kids | What are we teaching about technology? | Tool vs. authority, curiosity, skepticism |

---

## 1. Privacy and Data

**Questions to Ask:**

- **Is our data encrypted?** (At rest and in transit)
- **Is our data used to train AI models?** Reputable Family AI apps say no explicitly.
- **How long is data retained?** Can we export and delete?
- **What certifications exist?** SOC 2 Type II indicates serious security practices.
- **Who at the company can access our data?** (Support, engineers—under what conditions?)

**What Honeydew Does:**
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- Does not use your data to train public models
- Data export and deletion available

**Red Flags:**
- Vague privacy policy
- "We may use data to improve our services" without opt-out
- No encryption mentioned
- No way to delete data

---

## 2. Consent

**Questions to Ask:**

- **Do all adults in the family agree to use the app?** Forcing it on a reluctant partner undermines trust.
- **Do kids need to consent?** Depends on age and what they see. Younger kids may not need accounts; teens might.
- **What about extended family or co-parents?** If you add them to a shared group, have they agreed?
- **Can people opt out of specific features?** (e.g., voice, notifications)

**Practical Approach:**
- Discuss as a family before adopting
- Start with one household; expand only when others agree
- For co-parenting: both parents should agree to shared group usage

---

## 3. Agency and Overreliance

**Questions to Ask:**

- **Do we review AI suggestions before accepting?** Or do we blindly trust?
- **Can we easily correct the AI when it's wrong?** Override and feedback matter.
- **Are we outsourcing decisions we should make together?** (e.g., "AI picked the vacation dates" vs. "we discussed and chose")
- **Do we still know how to coordinate without the app?** (Power outage, vacation, device break)

**Practical Approach:**
- Treat AI as assistant, not authority
- Review calendar and list changes regularly, especially at first
- Use AI to reduce friction, not to replace family conversation
- Periodically practice "manual" coordination (e.g., paper backup)

---

## 4. Presence and Screen Time

**Questions to Ask:**

- **Does Family AI reduce or increase screen time?** Goal: less time on coordination, more time present.
- **Are we checking the app during meals or family time?** Boundaries matter.
- **Does voice reduce phone-in-hand?** Often yes—hands-free can mean more presence.
- **Are we modeling "always connected" for our kids?** Consider device-free zones.

**Practical Approach:**
- Set app-check boundaries (e.g., not during dinner)
- Use voice when possible to keep phone away
- Measure: did coordination time go down? If not, reassess.

---

## 5. Modeling for Kids

**Questions to Ask:**

- **What do we want our kids to learn about AI?** Tool vs. authority; curiosity vs. blind trust.
- **Do we explain how it works?** "It learned our patterns" is a teachable moment.
- **Do we show that we can correct it?** Models agency and critical thinking.
- **Are we comfortable with kids using it?** Depends on age and supervision.

**Practical Approach:**
- Talk about AI as a tool that helps but can make mistakes
- Let kids see you correct the AI when it's wrong
- For older kids: discuss privacy, data, and consent in age-appropriate ways

## Comparison: Ethical Posture of Family AI Products

| Dimension | Honeydew | General AI (ChatGPT) | Smart Home (Alexa) |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Data training | No training on your data | Check policy (varies) | Amazon may use for improvement |
| Encryption | Yes; SOC 2 | Yes | Yes |
| Consent | Family-level; you control groups | Individual | Household |
| Overreliance | You review; override available | User responsibility | User responsibility |
| Purpose-built for family | Yes | No | Partial |

## A Simple Checklist Before You Start

- [ ] Read the privacy policy (data use, training, retention)
- [ ] Check for SOC 2 or equivalent certification
- [ ] Discuss with partner/family; get consent
- [ ] Decide what kids can access (if any)
- [ ] Set boundaries (when to check app, device-free zones)
- [ ] Plan to review and correct AI; don't auto-accept everything
- [ ] Have a backup (paper calendar, shared doc) for outages

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is it ethical to use AI for family coordination?**
A: It can be. The key is informed consent, privacy protection, and avoiding overreliance. Use AI as a tool that serves your family's values, not as a replacement for judgment.

**Q: Should kids use Family AI?**
A: Depends on age and supervision. Young kids may only need to see a shared calendar. Teens might add to lists. Ensure parent oversight and age-appropriate access. Discuss what AI is and how it works.

**Q: How do I know if a Family AI app uses my data to train models?**
A: Check the privacy policy. Look for explicit "we do not use your data to train AI models" or similar. Reputable apps state this clearly. If unclear, contact support.

**Q: What if my partner doesn't want to use Family AI?**
A: Don't force it. You can use it for your own lists and calendar; sharing requires consent. Discuss the benefits and concerns. A trial period with opt-out can help.

**Q: Can Family AI make decisions for us?**
A: Family AI suggests and executes tasks (create event, add to list). It should not make value-laden decisions (where to vacation, how to discipline) without your input. You remain the decision-maker.

**Q: How do we avoid overreliance on Family AI?**
A: Review suggestions before accepting. Correct the AI when wrong. Periodically practice coordination without the app. Use it to save time, not to replace thinking.
